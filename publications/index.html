Although the need for high-performance materials with exceptional fatigue qualities has increased dramatically, the VHCF behavior of Al-Cu-Mg-Ag-TiB2 (A20X) structures remains largely unknown. A series of ultrasonic fatigue tests were performed to assess the prolonged fatigue life of the A20X alloy (in the VHCF domain where the number of cycles to failure is beyond 10 million cycles). The VHCF response, assessed through ultrasonic fatigue testing, was investigated by examining the stress-life (S-N) curves in a statistical framework, the fatigue crack initiation and propagation behavior, and the fracture surfaces. An asymptotic trend was experimentally found at 109 cycles, with a stress amplitude of 110 MPa for stress-relieved (SR) and 125 MPa for artificially aged (T7) materials, indicating the presence of an endurance limit. Furthermore, fracture surfaces showed the typical fisheye morphology, with a fine granular area (FGA) containing an internal crack-initiating site. The findings of this paper can assist in optimizing fatigue and durability design allowable for applications for extended fatigue life in the VHCF domains. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="BoursierNiutta2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Delamination Assessment in Composite Laminates through Local Impulse Excitation Technique (IET)</div> <div class="author"> C.

In this paper, a numerical analysis of the sensitivity of the local-IET to the delamination damage mechanism is conducted. Firstly, a Finite Element (FE) model of the local-IET test is determined through experimental investigations on undamaged composite laminates, which cover a wide range and are made of glass or carbon fibers, through resin infusion or pre-preg consolidation and with unidirectional or fabric textures. The vibrational response of a glass fiber composite with local delamination is then assessed with the local-IET. By modeling the delamination in the simulation environment, the effectiveness of the FE model in replicating the vibrational response, even in the presence of delamination, is shown through a comparison with the experimental results. Finally, the FE model is exploited to perform a sensitivity analysis, showing that the technique is able to detect the presence of delamination. © 2024 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ferrarese2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Statistical Mesoscale Approach to Model the Size Effect on the Tensile Strength of Notched Woven Composites</div> <div class="author"> A.

In the presence of notches, stress concentration affects a portion of material that increases with the notch size. Furthermore, in woven composites, the notch and tow size can be comparable, thus demanding a mesoscale approach to properly capture the stress intensification. In this paper, a probabilistic mesoscale method to model the size effect in notched woven composites is presented. First, the stress distribution is estimated with a finite element model, calibrated on experimental Digital Image Correlation data. The FE model simulates the mesoscale heterogeneity of the woven reinforced material and replicates the local stress intensification at the tow level. Then, a three-parameter Weibull-based statistical model is introduced to model the probability of failure from the calculated stress distribution and the volume of the part. An equivalent stress is used to capture the relevant fiber and matrix failure modes and the maximum value within the specimen volume is the random variable of the model. The method is applied to open-hole tension tests of a woven twill carbon fiber–epoxy composite. Two specimen widths and three width-to-diameter ratios, from 3 to 12, are considered. Specimen width produced an observable size effect, whereas the variation of hole size in the range considered did not. The statistical model is found to accurately describe the experimental observations, efficiently replicating an inverse size effect, regardless of hole size, while wider specimens lead to a lower probability of failure. © 2024 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Absorbing capabilities of additively manufactured lattice structure specimens for crash applications: Damage tolerant design and simulations</div> <div class="author"> A.

The composite laminates were fabricated using three commercial resins: a conventional epoxy resin, an epoxy resin with a 31% weight concentration of bio-renewable content, and a recyclable methyl methacrylate infusion resin. This aims to assess if there exists a commercially available alternative to the traditional epoxy resin that can reduce the overall carbon footprint of composite materials. To investigate the influence of humidity on the mechanical behavior of the flax layers, a drying treatment was applied to the fibers before the infusion process. Micro-computed tomography analysis revealed that heat treatment resulted in a reduction of porosity, although it did not affect the mechanical response of the composite laminates. Moreover, laminates produced with non-recyclable and sustainable resins exhibited no significant change in tensile and flexural modulus. In contrast, those produced with recyclable resin demonstrated a slight reduction in the strengths of the composite laminates. Conversely, out-of-plane impact tests and repeated impact tests indicated that composites prepared with recyclable and bio-epoxy resin formulations present superior damage resistance to repeated impact compared to traditional epoxy resin. © 2024 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Pederbelli2024124" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effects of singular and non-singular stress fields on very high cycle fatigue life of adhesive joints</div> <div class="author"> D.

Appropriate design plans should therefore be implemented to produce more reliable apparatus. This paper explores the effects induced by both the presence and the absence of stress singularities on the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) performance of adhesively bonded butt joints through analytical, numerical, and experimental methods. Analytical models defined the conditions to design a stress singularity-free joint, global–local finite element descriptions studied the stress distributions in detail, and then VHCF experiments extracted S–N outcomes. The suitability of this approach is confirmed numerically while a substantial increase of the joint life is experimentally observed if the singularity is removed. Nonetheless, a non-singular configuration leads to higher scatter data compared to the original specimen configuration. © 2023 The Authors.

Nonetheless, mechanical properties in numerical codes are assumed to be frequency-independent to simplify calculations or due to a lack of experimental data, and this approach could lead to overdesign or failures. This study aims to quantify the frequency effects in the fatigue applications of a bi-material adhesive joint through analytical, numerical, and experimental procedures. Analytical and finite element models allowed the specimen design, whereas the frequency effects were investigated through a conventional servo-hydraulic apparatus at 5, 25, and 50 Hz and with an ultrasonic fatigue testing machine at 20 kHz. Experimentally, the fatigue life increases with the applied test frequency. Run-out stress data at 109 cycles follow the same trend: at 25 Hz and 50 Hz, the run-out data were found at 10 MPa, increasing to 15 MPa at 20 kHz. The P–S–N curves showed that frequency effects have a minor impact on the experimental variability and that standard deviation values lie in the range of 0.3038–0.7691 between 5 Hz and 20 kHz. Finally, the trend of fatigue strengths at 2·106 cycles with the applied loading frequency for selected probability levels was estimated. © 2023 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="BoursierNiutta2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Strain Measurement with Optic Fibers for Structural Health Monitoring of Woven Composites: Comparison with Strain Gauges and Digital Image Correlation Measurements</div> <div class="author"> C.

The work aims at investigating the sensitivity of embedded and glued optic sensors for structural health monitoring applications in comparison with strain gauges and the full field strain map of the DIC. Acrylate, polyimide optic fibers, and three strain gauge sizes are considered to compare the three techniques. Results show hard polyimide-coated sensors are more sensitive to the material pattern than soft acrylate-coated fibers, which also require extensive adhesion length. The work shows a comparable size of strain gauges and material meso-structure is also critical for properly assessing material properties. The Young’s modulus computed with the three different techniques is used to define a strategy that supports the selection and the proper size of the adopted strain measuring system for structural health monitoring of composite materials. © 2023 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Experimental scatter of the fatigue response of additively manufactured components: a statistical method based on the Profile Likelihood</div> <div class="author"> A.

The analysis of the results of AM tests can be therefore complex: for example, the influence of a specific factor, e.g. the building direction, can be concealed by the experimental variability. Accordingly, appropriate statistical methodologies should be employed to safely and properly analyze the results of fatigue tests on AM specimens. In the present paper, a statistical methodology for the analysis of the AM fatigue test results is proposed. The approach is based on shifting the experimental failures to a reference number of cycles starting from the estimated P–S–N curves. The experimental variability of the fatigue strength at the reference number of cycles is also considered by estimating the profile likelihood function. This methodology has been validated with literature datasets and has proven its effectiveness in dealing with the experimental scatter typical of AM fatigue test results. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Statistical estimation of fatigue design curves from datasets involving failures from defects</div> <div class="author"> A.

In this work an experimental–numerical methodology for the identification of the lower bound design curve of lattice structures subjected to quasi-static compressive and impact tests is proposed and validated on an octet truss lattice structure made of an additively manufactured AlSi10Mg alloy. The defect size distribution is assessed through micro computed tomography and retained in a Finite Element Model (FEM) simulating the mechanical tests by a local reduction of the truss diameter. As the location of critical defects affects the mechanical response, simulations are repeated for different random distributions of the defects within the specimen. Results show that the FEM can correctly predict the mechanical behavior of the lattice structure, with the experimental curves comprised within the band of numerical curves.

Two defect-driven methodologies, which model the fatigue response in the finite life range and account for the experimental scatter, are compared. The first approach is based on the defect distribution and the marginal P-S-N curves. The second method models the size-effect by accounting for the stress distribution within the loaded material. The two approaches are used to assess the maximum allowable first principal stress, which causes crack propagation. As the fatigue strength depends on the component volume or the stress distribution, an iterative procedure is necessary to determine the optimal design. The optimal topologies of a cantilever beam and of an engine rod are determined and compared, showing that the defect-distribution method is the most conservative and the stress-gradient method can also be reliably applied in the case of uniform stress distribution, as in the engine rod. Furthermore, the choice of the volume to retain for the calculation of the fatigue strength in the defect-distribution method is critical. © 2023 The Authors.

Ultrasonic fully reversed tension–compression tests up to 109 cycles were carried out on unnotched specimens and specimens with a blunt notch. Unnotched specimens show a slightly larger fatigue response, with limited differences. All fatigue failures originated from defects, which are bigger in unnotched specimens, mainly due to the different risk volume of the tested specimens and the related size effect. Interactions between notch, stress gradient, and defect size distribution must be considered to properly assess the influence of notch on the VHCF response. © 2023 The Authors.

The considered thermoplastic resin, ELIUM®, is made of poly-methylmethacrylate and can be infused with properly tuned vacuum techniques, in the same manner as all liquid resin. Tensile, flexural, and drop-dart impact tests were carried out to assess the mechanical properties of the composites considering different fabrication conditions, such as the different degassing pressure before infusion and three different infusion vacuum pressures. The work reports a methodology to infuse ELIUM resin at a relatively high vacuum pressure of 0.8 bar. X-ray microtomography analysis showed that the produced laminates are free of defects, differently from what was reported in the literature, where void problems related to a vacuum infusion pressure higher than 0.3–0.5 bar were pointed out. Vacuum pressure values influence the mechanical characteristics of the laminate: when higher vacuum pressures are adopted, the mechanical properties of the GFRP laminates are enhanced and higher values of elastic modulus and strength are obtained. On the other hand, degassing the resin before infusion does not influence the mechanical properties of the laminates. A maximum bending and tensile strength of 420 and 305 MPa were reached by using the vacuum infusion of 0.8 bar with an elastic modulus of 18.5 and 20.6 GPa, respectively. The density of the produced laminates increases at higher vacuum infusion pressure up to a maximum value of 1.81 g/cm3 with the fibre volume fraction of each laminate. © 2023 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciampaglia2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Data driven method for predicting the effect of process parameters on the fatigue response of additive manufactured AlSi10Mg parts</div> <div class="author"> A.

In this study, these concurrent phenomena were studied using an experimental-numerical approach, considering the effect of the composite heterogeneity. An innovative simplified mesoscale model using shell elements to replicate the woven pattern was developed. The material properties of the model were identified with a data-driven optimization scheme that minimizes the difference between the experimental full-field strain, measured with Digital Image Correlation, and the one predicted by the model itself. The elastic properties identified for the material at tow level are analogous to that of a unidirectional composite, with longitudinal and transverse moduli of around 102 GPa and 15 GPa, respectively. The calibrated model was used to analyze the stress concentration and localization induced by circular notches with increasing diameter. A size effect describing the increase in the carbon fiber tow strength following the increase in stress localization was observed. The mesoscale material strength was found to increase by about 2.5 times in the presence of the notch, from 2131 to 3922 MPa in fiber direction, partially balancing the stress intensification effect of the hole that leads to an approximately three-fold stress increase in the material. © 2023 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2026" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Assessment of the Critical Defect in Additive Manufacturing Components through Machine Learning Algorithms</div> <div class="author"> A.

The fatigue response of AM parts is driven by manufacturing defects, which contribute to the experimental scatter and are strongly dependent on the process parameters, making the design process rather complex. The most effective design procedure would involve the assessment of the defect population and the defect size distribution directly from the process parameters. However, the number of process parameters is wide and the assessment of a direct relationship between them and the defect population would require an unfeasible number of expensive experimental tests. These multivariate problems can be effectively managed by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. In this paper, two ML algorithms for assessing the most critical defect in parts produced by means of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process are developed. The probability of a defect with a specific size and the location and scale parameters of the statistical distribution of the defect size, assumed to follow a Largest Extreme Value Distribution, are estimated directly from the SLM process parameters. Both approaches have been validated using literature data obtained by testing the AlSi10Mg and the Ti6Al4V alloy, proving their effectiveness and predicting capability. © 2023 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="BoursierNiutta2026" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Epoxy and Bio-Based Epoxy Carbon Fiber Twill Composites: Comparison of the Quasi-Static Properties</div> <div class="author"> C.

Sustainability can be achieved with both lightweight design and eco-friendly manufacturing processes. For example, concerns on the use of thermoset composite materials, with a lightweight design and a high specific strength, have arisen, since thermoset resins are not fully recyclable and are mainly petrol based. A possible solution to this issue is the replacement of the thermoset matrix with a recyclable or renewable matrix, such as bio-based resin. However, the mechanical properties of composites made with bio-based resin should be carefully experimentally assessed to guarantee a safe design and the structural integrity of the components. In this work, the quasi-static mechanical properties of composite specimens (eight layers of carbon fiber fabric) made with commercially available epoxy and a bio-based epoxy resins (31% bio content) are compared. Tensile tests on the investigated resins and tensile, compression, shear and flexural tests have been carried out on composite laminates manufactured with the two investigated resins. A finite element model has been calibrated in the LS-Dyna environment using the experimentally assessed mechanical properties. The experimental results have proven that the two composites showed similar quasi-static properties, proving that bio-based composite materials can be reliably employed as a substitute for epoxy resins without affecting the structural integrity of the component but lowering their carbon footprint. © 2023 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciardiello2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Adhesive Thickness and Ageing Effects on the Mechanical Behaviour of Similar and Dissimilar Single Lap Joints Used in the Automotive Industry</div> <div class="author"> R.

The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of compliant substrates on the mechanical performances of the adhesive. Differently from traditional Arcan tests, where highly rigid substrates are used, U-shaped specimens made of carbon prepreg, final thickness 1 mm and 2 mm, have been bonded with a stiff epoxy and polyurethane adhesives. Nonlinear finite element analyses were performed to assess the stress state in the adhesives obtained by the experimental tests and showed a good correlation with the experimental results. In particular, the shear and tensile tests with the thicker substrates were used to determine the properties of the adhesives, while the 45° loading case combined with the thinner substrate results were used for validation. Results show that the compliance of the substrates significantly affects the fracture propagation of both adhesives in Mode I, as well as the maximum load of the epoxy-based joint for all the loading conditions. The results suggest that the Arcan test is suitable for the complete characterization of this type of adhesive joints. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Colombo2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Efficient experimental methods for rapid fatigue life estimation of additive manufactured elements</div> <div class="author"> C.

Indeed, even in parts produced with optimized process parameters, the fatigue response can be worse than that of traditionally built (TB) components due to the presence of rare but very critical manufacturing defects. This chapter will focus on these rare defects that control the fatigue response.In particular, after a brief introduction on the defects which form during the AM processes, experimental fatigue datasets showing failures originating from defects are critically analyzed. The influence of process parameters and post-treatments is also investigated. Thereafter, the methodologies developed in the literature for modeling the influence of defects on the fatigue response are described. Finally, the design methodologies against fatigue failures from defects in AM parts currently available are described and compared, providing the reader with useful information for the assessment of the structural integrity of AM components. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, the fatigue life of components has significantly increased and can exceed one billion of cycles in many industrial sectors, such as, automotive and aerospace sectors. Accordingly, to ensure a safe fatigue design and the structural integrity of components produced through traditional and additive manufacturing (AM) processes, experimental tests investigating also the VHCF life range should be carried out. In this chapter, a comprehensive analysis of the VHCF response of AM parts is carried out. Literature results obtained by testing AlSi12, AlSi10Mg, AlSi7Mg, Ti6Al4V, IN718, and 316L steel specimens are analyzed. The factors affecting the VHCF response of AM parts and the influence of defects are highlighted and discussed for the analyzed material.

The majority of structural composite materials use petrol-based epoxy matrices which are not easily recyclable, thus representing a negative impact on the environment. The most promising and ready-to-use technology to lower the carbon footprint in composite materials is the use of bio-based resins partially derived from renewable resources since this replacement is not affecting the manufacturing processes. Two commercial resins, a cardanol-based epoxy resin (27% bio-content) and an epoxy novolac resin (84% bio-content), were mixed to obtain four different resin mixtures. In particular, the higher bio-content novolac resin was mixed with the cardanol epoxy resin in different weight percentages to reach a total bio-content higher than 27%. The resins obtained by this procedure are characterized by total bio-contents of 27%, 31%, 41% and 51%, calculated on biomass used in production. Quasi-static and dynamic tensile tests have been carried out to assess the mechanical behavior of the different resins at increasing bio-contents. The strain has been acquired by using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system to determine the failure modes with respect to the bio-content. The tests have shown that the increase of bio-content lead to lower Young’s modulus and lower ultimate strengths both decreasing with a linear trend in static and dynamic conditions. The glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of each mixture have been also studied by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analyses to assess the effect of the bio-content on the Tg values. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

In this context, the use of a natural fiber reinforced polymer in the design of structural components needs to be validated through experimental mechanical tests. This study provides an overview of the behaviors of flax/epoxy and hemp/epoxy laminates subjected to tensile, four-point bending, and Low-Velocity Impact (LVI) tests, both from an experimental and numerical point of view. For each type of test, finite element models were simulated using the explicit code LS-DYNA in order to characterize the materials, reproduce the load-displacement plots, and analyze the damage evolution of the laminates. Two different types of mesh modeling were investigated for the models: shell and solid elements. In both cases, a proper contact modeling between layers was carried out to account for delamination phenomena of the material. The results obtained show an agreement between the experimental response and the simulated one, highlighting the possibility of designing and manufacturing structural components in composite material reinforced with natural fibers. © IMechE 2023.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Vigna2023290" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Crash Testing of Polymer Matrix Composites Using Flat Specimens</div> <div class="author"> L.

However, among the multiple structural applications whose performance can be improved using composites, crashworthiness is one of the less common but with good perspectives for the future, thanks to the high level of energy absorption of these materials. In the present work, the crash behavior of three composite materials (a carbon/epoxy, a hybrid glass-carbon/vinyl ester and a carbon/vinyl ester laminate) was studied by performing in-plane compression tests of flat plates in impact conditions using a drop tower. The testing setup required a fixture to hold the specimen in vertical position and avoid buckling when loaded in in-plane direction. Two different versions of the testing fixture were compared. The first one requires a plate to transmit the load from the falling mass to the specimen, while in the second version the falling mass gets directly in contact with the specimen. The specimen crashed under the impact load, and the main failure mechanism was splaying with fronds. Both fixture versions worked effectively to crash the specimens and measure the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of the three materials. The carbon/epoxy and hybrid laminate showed a similar crash force, with the second having higher SEA because of the lower density. The carbon/vinyl ester material showed higher crash stress and SEA. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciardiello2023271" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Impact Response of Carbon Fiber Composites: Comparison Between Epoxy and Bio-Based Epoxy Matrices</div> <div class="author"> R.

The elastic properties of the two investigated composite plates have been found to be slightly different, if assessed with the IET. Similarly, the resin type has been found to not influence the impact response, for impact energy equal to 15 J (dart rebound) and to 30 J (dart penetration).

In order to be suitable for automotive applications, fatigue properties have to be carefully investigated to properly design structural components. Having in mind the automotive application, a particular composite material, a polyamide reinforced with 18%wt short glass fibres, has been considered. Uniaxial fatigue tensile tests with load ratio R = 0.1 were carried out on flat specimens made of the selected material. The experimental tests were performed using a hydraulic fatigue testing machine, in stress-controlled mode, with a loading frequency in the range of 0.5–3 Hz depending on the stress amplitude. P-S-N curves and endurance limit were determined according to the ISO standard 12107. Moreover, an innovative approach based on the Maximum Likelihood Principle (MLP) was used to estimate the P-S-N curves as well as the endurance limit. Obtained results showed that the estimation made with the MLP, reduces the total time of the test campaign and data fitting is more effective. Moreover, the material tested exhibits interesting properties for automotive applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Size-effects affecting the fatigue response up to 109 cycles (VHCF) of SLM AlSi10Mg specimens produced in horizontal and vertical directions</div> <div class="author"> A.

The use of plasma treatments is widely adopted in the automotive industries especially for polymers that present low surface energy, such as polypropylene. In this work, polypropylene substrates used in the automotive industries have been treated with two different techniques: vacuum and atmospheric plasma. Then, polyurethane and methacrylate adhesives have been used to bond single lap joints (SLJs). Typically, these two adhesives cannot bond polypropylene substrates without surface treatments. An experimental plan has been designed to investigate the process parameters that can increase the functional polar groups (FPGs) maximizing the adhesion strength. Besides the types of plasma, two different gas carriers (air and nitrogen) and different treatment times have been investigated. The substrates, treated and not treated, have been assessed through scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to quantitatively assess the increment of FPGs after the different treatments. The experimental plan shows that the atmospheric plasma can improve the surface of the substrates by using a smaller time. Mechanical tests on SLJs show that methacrylate and polyurethane cannot bond polypropylene substrates without the plasma treatment. On the other hand, the treated substrates can form a strong bonding with the adhesive since all SLJs exhibit a substrate failure. Mechanical tests have been also carried out after three different aging cycles showing that the adopted plasma treatment is not affected by the aging cycles. © The Author(s) 2021.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Niutta2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Experimental and Numerical Investigation of a Lattice Structure for Energy Absorption: Application to the Design of an Automotive Crash Absorber</div> <div class="author"> C.B.

The goal was to identify the most influencing parameters of the unit cell on the crushing performances of the structure, thus guiding the design of energy absorbers. Two full factorial plans of compression tests on cubic specimens of carbon nylon produced by fused deposition modeling (FDM) were performed. The factors were the beam diameter and the number of unit cells. In the first factorial plan, the specimen volume is constant and the dimensions of the unit cell are varied, while the second factorial plan assumes a constant size of the unit cell and the volume changes in accordance with their number. The results showed that the specific energy absorption increases with the diameter of the beam and decreases with the size of the unit cell. Based on these results, a crash absorber for the segment C vehicle was designed and compared with the standard component of the vehicle made of steel. In addition to a mass reduction of 25%, the improved crushing performances of the lattice structure are shown by the very smooth force-displacement curve with limited peaks and valleys. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, a new fixture to test composite plates applying an in-plane load has been used to investigate the effect of the impact velocity and of the friction caused by the fixture on the SEA of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy plates. The tests have been carried out using a drop tower testing machine and the effect of the friction has been studied varying the clamping force given by the fixture. Splaying is the main failure mechanism found in the specimens during the tests; SEA values (43.6 kJ/kg in average) increase with the clamping force due to the higher friction level induced by higher clamping force; impact velocity does not significantly influence the results. To avoid an overestimation of the SEA due to the excessive friction force (+5.6% when the clamping force increases from 0.8 kN to 8 kN), a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating has been applied to the anti-buckling supports to reduce the friction. The effect of this modification has been studied by carrying out a new test in which the specimen slides between the anti-buckling supports with a given clamping force. A significant reduction (-48% with same clamping force) of the friction force is obtained when the lubricant is applied. © 2021</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="BoursierNiutta20221449" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">On the influence of Additive Manufacturing defects on the energy absorption capability of a lattice structure</div> <div class="author"> C.

Two typologies of defects are considered through numerical simulations: i) the variation of the diameter of the beam with respect to the nominal value; ii) the presence of lack-of-fusion portions of material within the beams. The defects are randomly disposed in the unit cell and different defect populations are then simulated. Transient nonlinear finite element analyses of the lattice structure subjected to compression tests are performed in the LS-Dyna environment. The numerical model is validated with experimental data collected in a previously published work. Results show that both beam diameter variations and lack-of-fusion defects affect the absorbed energy although with different severities. The increasing degradation of the absorbed energy with the increasing numerosity of the defects confirms the necessity of accounting for these defects when designing lattice-based energy absorbers. © 2022 The Authors.

In industrial applications, starting from the P-S-N curves, the so-called “design curves” or “lower bound S-N curves” are defined for the design of components, in order to ensure a safety margin against fatigue failures. Due to the growing interest in the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response of materials, methodologies for the estimation of the design curves should not be limited to the Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF)-High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) life range but should also cover the VHCF region. In this work, the Maximum Likelihood Principle is exploited for the assessment of the design curves of datasets obtained through tests in the LCF-VHCF range, with the P-S-N curves showing a duplex trend. First, the model for the P-S-N curves with duplex trend is defined. Then the proposed methodology for the design curves is described and finally validated with literature datasets. © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In these structures it is important to have a geometric feature, known as failure trigger, to locally reduce the strength and initiate a stable crash failure avoiding excessive peak forces and instabilities. This is of particular importance for specimens dedicated to material characterization. In this study, triggers of six different geometries were machined on flat specimens made of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy. Crash tests were performed using a fixture developed to avoid the buckling of the plate loaded in the in-plane direction in quasi-static and impact loading conditions. Test results showed a strong effect of the trigger in the first part of the load-displacement curve (failure initialization). No effect was found in the steady crash region, where the force was approximately constant in all the tests. No significant influence of the trigger type was therefore detected on the SEA evaluation. © 2022 Vigna et al.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciardiello2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The mechanical performance of re-bonded and healed adhesive joints activable through induction heating systems</div> <div class="author"> R.

The adhesive is activable by using induction heating systems that can induce thermal heat in the particles throughout the electromagnetic field so they can melt the adhesive for bonding or separation procedures. The healing procedure consists of damaging single lap joint (SLJ) specimens with quasi-static and fatigue tests and then using an inductor to generate an electromagnetic field able to heat the adhesive to its melting point in order to heal the damaged SLJ specimens. SLJ tests were performed on damaged and healed specimens to assess, respectively, the residual mechanical properties of the damaged specimens and the mechanical properties after healing. SLJ tests showed that the healing procedure can completely recover the joint stiffness of the damaged adhesive joints, a huge part of the maximum shear strength and the SLJ absorbed energy. This work shows also the possibility of re-bonding completely failed or separated SLJs by using the same procedure. The mechanical properties of SLJs after healing and re-bonding are compared to the SLJ compared on virgin specimens to assess the recovered mechanical properties. © 2021 by the author.

After storage in distilled water at 37◦ C for two days, the specimens were tested using a chewing machine with a stainless-steel ball as an antagonist (49N loads, 250,000 cycles). Testing was performed using distilled water, Coca-Cola, and Red Bull as abrasive media. Wear and surface roughness analyses of the CAD/CAM materials were performed using a 3D profilometer and analyzed with two-way analysis of variance and post hoc pairwise comparison procedures. Worn surfaces were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Resin-based materials suffered higher volumetric wear than ceramics (p = 0.00001). Water induced significantly less volumetric wear than the other tested solutions (p = 0.0014), independent of the material tested. High-translucency zirconia showed less surface roughness than all the other materials tested. The selection of monolithic CAD/CAM materials to restore worn dentition due to erosive processes could impact restorative therapy stability over time. Resin-based materials seem to be more influenced by the acidic environment when subjected to a two-body wear test. © 2021 by the authors.

Damage tolerance approaches require a proper combination of material behavior description and nondestructive techniques. In contrast to metals, strength degradation approaches, i.e., the residual strength in pres-ence of cracks, are not straightforwardly enforceable in composites. The nonhomogeneous nature of such materials gives rise to several failure mechanisms and, therefore, the definition of an ulti-mate load carrying capacity is ambiguous. Nondestructive techniques are thus increasingly re-quired, where the damage severity is quantified not only in terms of damage extension, but also in terms of material response of the damaged region. Based on different approaches, many nonde-structive techniques have been proposed in the literature, which are able to provide a quantitative description of the material state. In the present paper, a review of such nondestructive techniques for laminated composites is presented. The main objective is to analyze the damage indexes related to each method and to point out their significance with respect to the residual mechanical perfor-mances, as a result of the working principle of each retained technique. A possible guide for future research on this subject is thus outlined. © 2021 by the authors.

These particles increase their temperature under electromagnetic field; in this way, they are able to melt the adhesive and, therefore, separate the adhesive joints. The mechanical properties of single lap joints (SLJs) prepared with the neat and modified adhesives have been performed by using different overlap lengths and thicknesses. SLJs prepared with the nanomodified adhesive present higher loads compared with the neat one. Separation tests have been carried out on SLJ specimens to measure the times needed to disassemble the adhesive joints.

It is acknowledged that defects appeared in the manufacturing stage or due to the impact and/or fatigue loads can develop along the vehicle riding. To avoid an unexpected failure of structural components, engineers ask for cheap methodologies assessing the health state of composite parts by means of continuous monitoring. Non Destructive Technique (NDT) for the damage assessment of composite structures are nowadays common and accurate, but an on-line monitoring requires properties as low cost, small size and low power that do not belong to common NDT. The presence of a damage in composite materials, either due to fatigue cycling or low-energy impact, leads to progressive degradation of elastic moduli and strengths. Since there is a well-known relationship between the elastic modulus reduction and the amount of damage, the stiffness degradation can be used for the scope of detecting the position and the amount of damage that has taken place. Relying on these concepts, a novel strain-based damage sensing procedure is here proposed, that can identify damages in composite structures by processing strain measures from a distributed sensors network. To achieve this result a combined Machine Learning pipeline, composed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and One Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) is proposed. First, PCA learns a linear transformation on the undamaged measurements to reduce the data dimensionality; secondly, OC-SVM trained to detect anomalies in the projected components. A cross-validation procedure is used to find the optimal pipeline configuration. The methodology is virtually tested on a carbon fiber suspension. The results suggest dropping the first components of the PCA to feed the classifier. In addition, results show the capability of the algorithm to detect anomalies in the component strain response. © 2021 SAE International.

Structural topology optimization is largely employed since it permits to minimize the component weight and maximize its stiffness and, accordingly, optimize its resistance under structural loads. On the other hand, thermal topology optimization has been less investigated, even if in many applications, such as turbine blades, engines, heat exchangers, thermal loads have a crucial impact. Currently, structural and thermal optimizations are mainly considered separately, despite the fact that they are both present and coupled in components in service condition. In the present paper, a novel methodology capable of defining the optimized structure under simultaneous thermomechanical constraints is proposed. The mathematical formulation behind the optimization algorithm is reported. The proposed methodology is finally validated on literature benchmarks and on a real component, confirming that it permits to define the topology, which presents the maximized thermal and mechanical performance. © IMechE 2020.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Caivano2021221" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">TopFat methodology implemented in a commercial software: Benchmarking validation</div> <div class="author"> R.

For this reason, the use of AM components has significantly increased. Moreover, the combined use of Topology Optimization (TO) algorithms and AM production processes has permitted to manufacture components with optimized stiffness mass distribution. When components are designed with TO algorithms, constraints on the maximum allowable stress within the component, e.g. the yield stress or the fatigue limit if quasi-static or cyclic loads are applied, respectively, are set to guarantee their structural integrity under several loading conditions. However, even with optimized process parameters, detrimental manufacturing defects, like pores, cluster of pores and lack of fusion defects, can form within the component affecting the fatigue response and lowering the fatigue limit. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the influence of defects when AM components are designed. To this aim, the Authors recently developed a property TO code, named TopFat, that provides the optimized topology by also considering the influence of defects on the fatigue response. In the present paper, the developed TopFat methodology is implemented by using a commercial software. The optimized topologies for literature traditional benchmarks obtained with the property code are compared with those obtained with the TopFat methodology implemented by using a commercial software. The differences between the two topologies are highlighted and discussed, with the aim of showing that the TopFat methodology can be reliably used for the design against fatigue failures from defects even with TO algorithms available in commercial software. © 2021 The Authors.

The technique aims at determining the local variation of the elastic properties in the damaged region of a composite component. Based on the Impulse Excitation Technique (IET), the vibrational response of the inspected region is isolated by clamping its extremities through vacuum, thus allowing the assessment of local variations. Complementarily, a new analytical approach is derived for the assessment of the residual elastic properties of the damaged area from the measurement of the first resonant frequency. Validation of the proposed methodology is performed on two glass-fibre woven fabric composites, damaged by impact. The material properties of the damaged zone determined through the proposed technique are compared to the results of tensile tests performed on specimens cut from the impacted plates. In particular, the specimens are equipped with optic fibre in order to punctually measure the elastic parameters. Results show that the residual elastic properties assessed with the proposed technique are in very good agreement with those measured through the optic fibre, thus proving the effectiveness of the methodology. © 2021 The Authors.

Depending on the application, the mechanical properties of the unit cell can be modified by varying its geometry. The cell geometry is generally designed through Finite Element Analyses. However, the simulation of the mechanical response of components made of lattice structures can be rather complex, due to the long computation time. Therefore, efficient simplified models should be employed, but, in this case, an experimental validation is required. In the paper, experimental compression tests are carried out on cubic specimens in lattice structures produced with a carbon nylon filament through a Fused Deposition Modeling process and with an AlSi10Mg alloy through a Selective Laser Melting process. The tests on carbon nylon specimens are carried out to assess the cell geometry ensuring the highest energy absorption among five selected cell geometries. Subsequently, a Finite Element (FE) model of the lattice structure specimens is created by using 1D beam elements and experimentally validated with the results obtained by testing manufactured specimens. The activity in the paper proves the effectiveness of models with 1D elements for the simulation of the mechanical response of the lattice structures and the importance of validating FE models to assess their real failure mode. © 2021 The Authors.

Indeed, AM allows creating the complex geometries provided by TO algorithms. However, AM processes such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or Electron Beam Melting (EBM) suffer from local slight fluctuations of the process parameters during the building phase, leading to the formation of defects, like pores, clusters of pores, lack of fusion defects, that drive the fatigue response of the material. For this reason, the TO algorithm must consider the presence of the defect population to reliably design the optimised component in the fatigue regime. Recently, the Authors developed a defect-driven TO algorithm with proprietary code, named TopFat, that exploits the Murakami fatigue model to safely design the AM optimised components. In the present paper, the TopFat methodology is extended to the HyperWorks commercial software to unlock a wide-ranging set of industrial and academic applications. This extension allows including the defect population within the TO algorithm without the need for a specific complex code. © 2021 The Authors.

Thirty root canals of extracted permanent teeth were used. Root canals were divided according to canal length (CL) and canal curvature (CC). The reference cusp and the root end were flattened to provide reproducible and accurate measurements. During shaping, the WL measurements were obtained with manual k-files (KF) and transferred to WaveOne (W1) NiTi reciprocating files using the traditional method with the endodontic ruler (method I) and an alternative clinical procedure based on the comparison of the instruments side by side from tip to shank (method II). For each file and each tested method, two measures were taken by two examiners using Rhino (ver. 4.0, McNeel, Seattle, WA, USA) software for a total of 360 (30 × 3 × 2 × 2) measures. Analysis of variance was performed by taking the difference in length (Delta WL, DWL) between files used for the same canal. The difference between methods I and II for WL transfer was found to be statistically significant (df = 1; F = 71.52; p &lt; 0.001). The DWL absolute values obtained with method II were found to be closer to 0 mm (i.e., same length as corresponding KF) than those obtained with method I. Both CL (df = 2; F = 1.27; p = 0.300) and CC (df = 1; F = 2.22; p = 0.149) did not significantly influence WL measurements. With respect to WL transfer, method II seemed to better preserve the correct WL transfer between instruments during the clinical endodontic procedures. © 2020 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Caivano20201267" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Topology and fibre orientation simultaneous optimisation: A design methodology for fibre-reinforced composite components</div> <div class="author"> R.

Therefore, the development of design methodologies capable to simultaneously optimize the shape of the fibre-reinforced composite part and the fibre orientation in the additive manufacturing process is, at present, of utmost interest among industries and research centres. In this paper, a novel simultaneous optimisation method capable to optimise the topology and the local fibre orientation is proposed. The method is computationally cheap, fast convergent and permits to avoid stress peaks, working efficiently on 2D and on 3D models. The analytical formulation of the problem and the optimisation algorithm are at first described. The optimisation criteria are based on the uniform strain energy density distribution and the fibre alignement along the principal stress direction. The proposed method is then verified with several benchmarks from the literature and with a 3D illustrative example, confirming that it can be effectively and efficiently employed for the optimisation of composite components to be produced through additive manufacturing. © IMechE 2020.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciardiello20201003" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effect Of Accelerated Ageing Cycles On The Physical And Mechanical Properties Of A Reversible Thermoplastic Adhesive</div> <div class="author"> R.

The use of this nano-modified adhesive coupled with this technology, offers an improved resistance to applied loads, new opportunities connected with the bonding process and the possibilities to dismantle plastic components for reusing, repairing or recycling at the end of life. In this research activity, the mechanical properties of the pristine and modified adhesive have been assessed. Furthermore, the effect of three different accelerated ageing cycles, currently used by automotive industries, have been studied in relation to the mechanical behaviour and separation time. Three ageing cycles were evaluated that are: hot, humid and mixed cycles. Single Lap Joint tests prove the variations of the mechanical properties and adhesion strength during the accelerated ageing, especially for the hot cycle. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy has been used and shows that the adhesives exposed to the hottest ageing cycle presented a high value of the oxidation that leads to a partial detachment of the adhesive from the plastic substrates. Joint separations by means of an induction heating system showed that adhesive joints can be separated before and after ageing cycles. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor &amp; Francis.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effect of microstructure, residual stresses and building orientation on the fatigue response up to 109 cycles of an SLM AlSi10Mg alloy</div> <div class="author"> A.

Two different processes have been considered for the joint dismounting, namely the already studied electromagnetic induction and an innovative microwave heating process. Besides the mentioned heating activation process, a full experimental plan has been designed that includes two different weight percentages (5% and 10%) of the nanoparticles and two alternative mixing methods: hand-mixing and extrusion methods. The mechanical performances and the separation tests have been assessed by using single lap joints. The adhesive joints prepared with the nanomodified adhesives and with the hand-mixing method presents a slightly larger value of the maximum strength due to the presence of small agglomerates that have been observed with scanning electron microscope analysis. On the other hand, the extrusion method gave a very uniform distribution of the particles within the adhesive matrix. Microwave and induction heating tests conducted on both the single lap joint and the adhesive itself showed that the joint separation and the melting of the adhesive are possible by using both adhesives prepared with the two mixing methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello20201555" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Fatigue response up to 109 cycles of a structural epoxy adhesive</div> <div class="author"> A.

Resin blocks simulating root canals were used. One was shaped with ProGlider and ProTaper Next (PTN) X1-X2 and one with ScoutRace and BioRace (BR) 1, 2 and 3. Both resin blocks were virtually replicated with computer-aided design (CAD) software. The endodontic instruments ProTaper Next (PTN) X2 and BioRace BR3 were also replicated with CAD. The NiTi instruments and the shaped blocks geometries were discretized and exported for FEA. The instrument rotation in the root canals was simulated. The finite element simulation was performed by applying an insertion and extraction force of 2.5 N with a constant rotational speed (300 rpm). To highlight possible differences between pressure distributions against the root canal portions outside and inside the canal curvature, the parameter Var was originally defined. Var values were systematically lower for PTN X2, revealing a better centering ability. FEA proved effective for the virtual prediction of the centering ability of NiTi instruments during an early design phase without the use of prototypes. © 2020 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Ultrasonic VHCF tests on very large specimens with risk-volume up to 5000 mm3</div> <div class="author"> A.

The fatigue cracks in VHCF originate from the largest defect present within the loaded material volume (risk-volume) and the larger the risk-volume, the larger the probability of critical defects affecting the VHCF response (size-effect). Many models have been proposed in the literature to deal with size-effects in VHCF. However, the proposed models cannot be validated on full-scale components, since VHCF tests are typically carried out with ultrasonic fatigue testing machines. The authors have proposed a specimen geometry, the so-called Gaussian specimens, to enlarge as much as possible the risk-volume in ultrasonic VHCF tests. In this study, fully reversed tension-compression ultrasonic VHCF tests up to 109 cycles were carried out on AISI H13 steel Gaussian specimens with a risk-volume of 5000 mm3, two times larger than the largest tested in the literature. The stress distribution and the absence of bending loads were verified with strain gages, proving that VHCF tests on risk-volumes of 5000 mm3 can be reliably carried out. Ultrasonic VHCF tests were also carried out on small hourglass specimens, confirming that larger risk-volumes allow for a more reliable design against VHCF failures. © 2020 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciardiello2026" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Experimental investigation on adhesively bonded U-shaped metallic joints using the Arcan test</div> <div class="author"> R.

The main goal of this work is to characterize the mechanical behaviour of the adhesive joints subjected to different loading angles and understand whether the cataphoresis painting process can be used to cure the adhesive. To this aim, two different typical temperatures, used for the cataphoresis process, have been used for curing the studied adhesive. Arcan test has been used to characterize the mechanical behaviour of the adhesive joints by using five different loading angles: 0° (shear condition), 30°, 45°, 60° (combined shear-tensile), and 90° (tensile). The experimental tests showed that the adopted curing cycles conducted at 190 °C for 15′ and 160 °C for 45′ are both able to fully cure the adhesive, this was verified with Differential Scanning Calorimeter analysis (DSC). The two curing temperatures do not lead to significant differences in the maximum values of the strength. Arcan test conducted at different loading angles shows that the maximum value of the strength is obtained for the condition of shear loading (about 10 MPa nominal strength), while the lowest value is related to the condition of tensile loading (about 5 MPa nominal strength). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis was used to assess the distribution of the hollow glass spheres that are embedded in this adhesive to set the thickness layer. © 2020</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2027" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">VHCF response of AM materials: A literature review</div> <div class="author"> A.

However, the complexity of the damage evolution in composite materials significantly limits their widespread diffusion. Non-destructive tests are thus becoming ever more important. The detecting Damage Index (DId) technique has been recently brought in the realm of the non-destructive characterization tests for components made of composite material. In contrast to other techniques, this methodology allows to quantitatively assess local residual properties. In this paper, the DId technique is adopted in combination with the finite element method. The mechanical response of two composite plates (an 8-layer twill fabric carbon/epoxy) subjected to four-point bending test is firstly used to tune a finite element model of the laminate. Then, an undamaged laminate of the same composite material is progressively damaged through repeated four-point bending tests. Local residual elastic properties are mapped on the plate through the DId technique. A continuous polynomial curve has been considered to account for the variation of the elastic modulus in the finite element model. The resulting force-displacement curve of the numerical analysis is compared to experimental data of damaged plate, resulting in very good agreement. The combination of the experimental activity and the numerical finite element analysis points out the accuracy of the DId methodology in assessing local residual elastic properties of composite materials. © 2019 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciardiello2019117" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Physical and mechanical properties of a reversible adhesive for automotive applications</div> <div class="author"> R.

Fe 3 O 4 particles with a weight concentration of 3%, 5% and 10% were embedded in the adhesive matrix. Single Lap Joint (SLJ) tests showed that a slight increase of the maximum load and a more ductile behaviour are obtained. The sensitivity of these modified adhesive performance to the induction heating process was studied with respect to some relevant parameters: the current (or power), the frequency of the electromagnetic induction field and the shape of the coil. Furthermore, the diameter of the hollow copper coil was modified in order to understand whether the coil temperature has an effect on the separation time. The separation time, that is an index of the time needed to reach the melt of the adhesive and the consequent SLJ separation, together with the temperature profile of the adhesives have been used to evaluate the sensitivity of these adhesives to the process parameters. The analysis on the temperature and separation time showed that the most influencing parameter is the frequency of the electromagnetic induction field. As expected, also the shape of the coil influences the separation time, in particular, the adhesive joint separated with the pancake coil showed lower values of the separation time compared to the solenoidal coils. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) showed that iron oxide particles tend to form small agglomerate that resulted well dispersed in the adhesive matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to verify that the separation procedure do not degrades these modified adhesives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">VHCF response of two AISI H13 steels: Effect of manufacturing process and size-effect</div> <div class="author"> A.

Therefore, the interest in the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) behavior of materials has grown rapidly, becoming a subject of primary interest among university and industries. In high-strength steels, VHCF failures generally originate from defects/inclusions; consequently, the steel cleanliness significantly affects the VHCF response. Furthermore, since the probability of finding critical defects in a loaded volume increases with the loaded volume, the loaded volume also significantly affects the VHCF response. This is generally referred to as the “size-effect” in VHCF. The present paper investigates the effects of the manufacturing process and the size-effect on the VHCF response of an AISI H13 steel. Experimental tests were performed on hourglass and Gaussian specimens made of two different types of AISI H13 steels: Unrefined H13 and refined Electroslag Remelting (ESR) H13. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), which was carried out on the test results, and the P–S–N curves showed that the two factors (i.e., the manufacturing process and the size-effect) significantly affect the VHCF response. © 2019 by the author.

Although they present many advantages, the impossibility to dismantle easily adhesive joints in order to substitute, recycle, reuse vehicle components or avoid waste for bonding errors is a factor that can limit their use. Furthermore, in Europe, the need to separate vehicle components for reuse and recycling is constrained by two Directives, 2000/53/EC and 2000/64/EC. These Directives set the objectives of reuse and recyclability for automotive vehicles, which are 95% and 85% respectively by an average weight per vehicle. For these reasons, it is very important to find a feasible solution to these problems. A promising technology for the separation of plastic joints, bonded with thermoplastic adhesives, uses nanomodified thermoplastic adhesives that are sensitive to electromagnetic fields. In this work, the mechanical behavior of adhesive joints made with a polyolefin adhesive, used in the automotive industry for bonding plastic components, have been studied. In particular, the adhesive has been modified with three different weight concentrations (3%, 5% and 10%) of iron oxide nanoparticles in order to make it sensitive to electromagnetic fields. These nanoparticles heat when are under the effect of an electromagnetic field and consequently they can melt the thermoplastic adhesive allowing for the joint separation. The mechanical properties of the joints prepared with the pristine and nanomodified particles have been studied by means of SLJ specimen with different overlap length and thicknesses. The adhesive joints prepared with the modified adhesives present a slightly higher load and a larger ductility compared to the ones prepared with the pristine one. Furthermore, separation tests have been performed in order to assess the times to disassemble these adhesive joints. Scanning electron microscope analysis has been used to assess the dispersion of the particles. © 2019 The Authors.

In particular, due to the layer-by-layer production, the load orientation, with respect to the building direction, plays a fundamental role for the fatigue response. This paper investigates the fatigue response up to 109 cycles (very high cycle fatigue (VHCF)) of selective laser melting (SLM) AlSi10Mg specimens built in a vertical direction. Ultrasonic tension-compression tests (stress ratio of -1) are carried out on as-built Gaussian specimens with a large loaded volume (2300 mm3). Fracture surfaces are investigated with the scanning electron microscope to analyze the defects originating the VHCF failure. Probabilistic S-N curves are estimated and analyzed. Experimental results confirm that the defect size controls the VHCF response, thus highlighting the importance of testing large risk volumes for a reliable assessment of VHCF behavior. The average value of the VHCF strength is close to that of the hourglass specimen tested in the literature. The variability of the VHCF strength is instead significantly larger, due to the scattered size distribution of the defects located near the specimen surface, which is the most critical region for crack initiation. © 2019 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello201984" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">An innovative testing technique for assessing the VHCF response of adhesively bonded joints</div> <div class="author"> A.

In presence of a rapidly varying load, such as a high-frequency vibration, adhesively bonded joints may undergo fatigue lives in the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) region that are significantly larger than those investigated in usual high-cycle fatigue tests. The present paper proposes an innovative testing technique for performing accelerated fully reversed tension-compression VHCF tests on adhesive butt-joints. The procedure for the design of the adherends is described and then experimentally validated. Ultrasonic VHCF tests are finally carried out on a cyanoacrylate butt-joint up to 109 cycles: experimental results show that the proposed testing equipment permits an effective assessment of the VHCF response of the adhesive in a limited testing time. © 2018 Wiley Publishing Ltd.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciardiello20181051" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Impact response of adhesive reversible joints made of thermoplastic nanomodified adhesive</div> <div class="author"> R.

Drop dart tests at different impact velocities are carried out on neat and nanomodified bonded joints in order to compare the impact behavior before and after the introduction of nanoparticles. Experimental results show that the impact response, assessed in terms of peak load, absorbed energy, and flexural stiffness, can be affected by the introduction of nanoparticles.

Surrogate modeling has been shown to further reduce computational effort as well as to smooth noisy responses. Crashworthiness optimization problems are, though, ill posed as they include nonlinear, noncontinuous and noisy responses. This violates the Hadamard conditions for well-posed problems and therefore the applicability of gradient-based algorithms is limited. Here, discontinuities in the responses with respect to the design variables will be handled that result in large changes in the system functions with only small changes in the design variables using a novel surrogate modeling technique. The applicability of typical global surrogate models is limited when critical discontinuities are present. An efficient method has been developed here to identify the number of discontinuities and their position in the design domain. Previous works assume a said number of discontinuities; here though, the number of discontinuities is not given a priori. The discontinuities are identified by examining the relative difference in the response value of samples in immediate proximity of each other. Samples in the same continuous subdomain are clustered and a support vector machine for classification is exploited to locate discontinuities. Local approximations are then used for the continuous subspaces between the discontinuities. Lastly, a surrogate-based design optimization is carried out. Starting with a two-bar truss, demonstrating a snap-through discontinuity, this method is shown to account for such discontinuities. This is then integrated into an optimization framework. Further academic example, namely a six-bar truss is modeled using the open-source framework Kratos Multiphysics and then optimized, showing the applicability of the method to problems with multiple discontinuities. Finally, a crash-absorbing tube is optimized that is impacted with an angle resulting in a noncontinuous design space: desired axial crushing and undesirable global buckling. After summarizing the results, advantages and possible limitations are discussed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Paolino20181363" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effect of thickness on the damage tolerance of glass/epoxy laminates subject to repeated impacts</div> <div class="author"> D.S.

Mechanical and physical properties of these reversible adhesives were experimentally assessed in the work. The modified adhesives, coupled with electromagnetic induction, are able to guarantee separation of the joints without any damage to the substrates for recycling, reuse or repairing of components. Single lap joint specimens were prepared using epoxy/glass fibres substrates and tests were carried out on neat and modified adhesive with 5% weight of iron and iron oxide. Three different Fe particles size were tested: 450 µm, 60 µm and 1–6 µm. The particles size of iron oxide was 50 nm. Separation was studied using single lap joint specimens under electro-magnetic induction. Experimental results showed that the maximum peak load decreases when the average particles sizes increase. The peak loads of the smallest particles were equal to the ones of the pristine adhesive. The elongation of the adhesives increases when the adhesive is modified with both iron and iron oxide particles. Finally, experimental tests on single lap joints coupled with electro-magnetic induction showed that separation of the substrates is possible using iron oxide particles. Electro-magnetic tests conducted on particles alone, helped to understand that bigger particles are able to overcome the melting temperature of the adhesive but hot-melt adhesives modified with these particles are not able to reach the melting. These tests showed that the number of particles into the adhesive matrix is very important for this kind of tests. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Paolino2018718" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Estimation of P-S-N curves in very-high-cycle fatigue: Statistical procedure based on a general crack growth rate model</div> <div class="author"> D.S.

By introducing a reduction term in the typical formulation of the threshold for crack growth, the authors recently proposed a general phenomenological model, which can effectively describe crack growth from internal defects in VHCF. The model is able to consider the different crack growth scenarios that may arise in VHCF and is enough general to embrace the various weakening mechanisms proposed in the literature for explaining why crack can grow below the threshold. In the present paper, the model is generalized in a statistical framework. The statistical distributions of the crack growth threshold and of the initial defect size are put into the model. The procedure for the estimation of the Probabilistic-S-N curves and of the fatigue limit distribution is illustrated and numerically applied to an experimental dataset. © 2017 Wiley Publishing Ltd.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Niutta20182867" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Improvements in the structural analysis of a composite material t-joint structure</div> <div class="author"> C.B.

The studied thermoplastic adhesives are Hot-Melt Adhesive (HMA). In particular, a pristine and a nanomodified adhesive with 10% in weight of iron oxide have been considered. The adhesives have been subjected to a series of single lap joint (SLJ) tests using adherends made of polypropylene copolymer. As it is well-known, the structural-mechanical behavior of adhesive joints is mostly influenced by the bonding process: thickness of adhesive as well as its application procedures and the surface preparation of adherends are among the most influencing factors. In addition, the mechanical behavior of SLJ test is particularly influenced by the correct alignment of adherends and applied load. These aspects have been investigated, analyzing the experimental results. Moreover, the experimental results have been used to develop a numerical model of the two adhesives. The numerical analysis has been carried out using the commercial software LS-DYNA. Transient nonlinear finite element analysis has been performed to simulate the mechanical behavior of the thermoplastic adhesives. In particular, the cohesive formulations of the elements have been taken into consideration after a careful literature review. In order to set-up and to validate the mechanical properties of the adhesives, the experimental SLJ tests have been simulated. The developed finite element models enable to investigate more complex joint structures where these types of adhesives are used, such as plastic piping systems and automotive applications. Further, the numerical models allow to investigate with higher accuracy and lower time different aspects such as manufacturing and non-linear effects. © Copyright 2018 ASME.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciardiello2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Experimental assessment of the dynamic behavior of polyolefin thermoplastic hot melt adhesive</div> <div class="author"> R.

Adhesive joints are often preferred to traditional fasteners due to the many advantages that they offer. For instance, adhesive joints show a better stress distribution compared to the traditional fasteners and high mechanical properties under different loading conditions. Furthermore, they are usually preferred for joining components made of different materials. A wide variety of adhesives is currently available: thermoset adhesives are generally employed for structural joints but recently there has been a significant increment in the use of thermoplastic adhesives, in particular of the hot-melt adhesives (HMAs). HMAs permit to bond a large number of materials, including metal and plastics (e.g., polypropylene, PP), which can be hardly bonded with traditional adhesives. Furthermore, HMAs are characterized by a short open time and, therefore, permit for a quick and easy assembly process since they can be easily spread on the adherend surfaces by means of a hot-melt gun and they offer the opportunity of an ease disassembling process for repair and recycle. For all these reasons, HMAs are employed in many industrial applications and are currently used also for bonding polypropylene and polyolefin piping systems. In the present paper, the dynamic response of single lap joints (SLJ) obtained by bonding together with a polyolefin HMA two polypropylene substrates was experimentally assessed. Quasi-static tests and dynamic tests were carried out to investigate the strain rate effect: dynamic tests were carried out with a modified instrumented impact pendulum. Relevant changes in the joint performance have been put in evidence. Failure modes were finally analysed and compared. A change in the failure mode is experimentally found: in quasi-static tests SLJ failed due to a cohesive failure of the adhesive, whereas in dynamic tests the SLJ failed due to an interfacial failure, with a low energy absorption. © Copyright 2018 ASME.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Belingardi201818" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Composite material components damaged by impact loading: A methodology for the assessment of their residual elastic properties</div> <div class="author"> G.

We focus on damage due to impact loading on long fibre, plastic matrix composite, as they represent one of the most interesting development solution for automotive components toward lightweight structure that in turn means reduction of fuel consumption and of Green House Gas emissions. Design/methodology/approach: An innovative simplified methodology is proposed, based on the impact and repeated impact behaviour of composite material, for the evaluation of the induced damage and of material residual elastic properties. The investigated composite laminate is made of eight twill-wave carbon fabrics impregnated with epoxy resin. The methodology consists of two phases: at first the identification of the impact response. Composite plates have been impacted at different energy levels and residual elastic properties measured through standard tensile tests. The relationship between impact energy and residual elastic properties is obtained. Then the exploration impact load is identified, large enough to give a well-defined picture of the suffered damage but soft enough to do not induce further damage in the composite laminate. Findings: This exploration impact test and the Damage Index (DI) value, as interpretation key, leads to a prediction of the local residual elastic properties in the damaged area. The proposed methodology has been validated on plate specimens. A strict correlation is found between the predicted and the actual residual elastic properties of the damaged composite plate. Practical implications: Subsequently it has been applied to a composite beam, with a omega shape transverse section, that can be considered as a demonstrator for a typical beam used in the car body frame. Originality/value: A selection on the following alternatives will be possible: a – don’t care the damage is not affecting the structure performance; b – repair is needed but will be sufficient; c – substitute the damaged component as soon as possible. © International OCSCO World Press.

Potentialities and weaknesses in the application of the IET for the assessment of the residual elastic properties are finally discussed and highlighted in the paper. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ciardiello20179" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effects of carbon black and graphene nano-platelet fillers on the mechanical properties of syntactic foam</div> <div class="author"> R.

In treated GnPs the hollow glass spheres and the GnPs were treated with 1-Pyrenecarboxaldehyde in xylene. The flexural, tensile, compressive and Izod properties of the five different combinations of these syntactic foams, both reinforced and not reinforced, were measured and compared with the pristine epoxy.

Currently, several refining processes permit to reduce the characteristic defect size and permit to remove large defects in high-strength steels, thus inducing a possible significant enhancement of the VHCF response. The present paper investigates the effects of a specific refinement process, the Electro-Slag Remelting (ESR), on the VHCF response of an AISI H13 steel. Ultrasonic VHCF tests are carried out on large Gaussian specimens made of unrefined and refined AISI H13 steels. Fracture surfaces are investigated to compare inclusion populations before and after the ESR process. Finally, the fatigue limit and the design S-N curves are statistically estimated to quantify the beneficial effects induced by the ESR process. © 2017 Wiley Publishing Ltd.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Alovisi2017387" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Micro-CT evaluation of several glide path techniques and ProTaper Next shaping outcomes in maxillary first molar curved canals</div> <div class="author"> M.

Methodology: Forty-five extracted maxillary first permanent molars were selected. Mesio-buccal canals were randomly assigned (n = 15) to manual K-file, PathFile or ProGlider groups for glide path preparation. Irrigation was achieved with 5% NaOCl and 10% EDTA. After glide path preparation, each canal was shaped with ProTaper Next X1 and X2 to working length. Specimens were scanned (isotropic voxel size 9.1 μm) for matching volumes and surface areas and post-treatment analyses. Canal volume, surface area, centroid shift, canal geometry variation through ratio of diameter ratios and ratio of cross-sectional areas were assessed in the apical and coronal levels and at the point of maximum canal curvature. One-way factorial anovas were used to evaluate the significance of instrument in the various canal regions. Results: Post-glide path analysis revealed that instrument factor was significant at the apical level for both the ratio of diameter ratios and the ratio of cross-sectional areas (P &lt; 0.001), with an improved maintenance of root canal geometry by ProGlider and PathFile. At the coronal level and point of maximum canal curvature, ProGlider demonstrated a tendency to pre-flare the root canal compared with K-file and PathFile. PathFile and ProGlider demonstrated a significantly lower centroid shift compared with K-file at the apical level (P = 0.023). Post-shaping analysis demonstrated a more centred preparation of ProGlider, compared with PathFile and K-files, with no significant differences for other parameters. Conclusions: Use of ProGlider instruments led to less canal transportation than PathFiles and K-files. © 2016 International Endodontic Journal.

However, damage complexity still represents the main limitation in the further diffusion of structural composites. In this paper, an innovative non-destructive methodology for assessing the amount of damage in composite materials is proposed. The macro energetic variable Damage Index is exploited for the prediction of the local residual elastic properties in damaged composites for automotive applications. A strict correlation is found between the predicted and the actual residual elastic properties of the investigated plates. The methodology could thus represent an effective way for guiding the maintenance strategy in structural composite components subjected to damage during service. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Paolino2017335" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effect of defect size on P-S-N curves in Very-High-Cycle Fatigue</div> <div class="author"> D.S.

VHCF failures generally nucleate from internal defects, whose size strongly affects the material strength and life. Therefore, S-N curves in the VHCF regime are defect size dependent and the scatter of fatigue data is significantly influenced by the statistical distribution of the defect size within the material. The present paper proposes an innovative approach for the statistical modeling of Probabilistic-S-N (P-S-N) curves in the VHCF regime. The proposed model considers conditional P-S-N curves that depend on a specific value of the initial defect size. From the statistical distribution of the initial defect size, marginal P-S-N curves are estimated and the effect of the risk-volume on the VHCF response is also modeled. Finally, the paper reports a numerical example that quantitatively illustrates the concepts of conditional and marginal P-S-N curves and that shows the effect of the risk-volume on the VHCF response. © 2017 The Authors.

More than 95% of the total VHCF life is consumed in originating the so-called Fine Granular Area (FGA) around the small initial defect. Within the FGA, crack growth takes place even if the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is smaller than the threshold value for crack growth. Researchers proposed different explanations for this unexpected phenomenon but they unanimously accept that a weakening mechanism occurs around the initial defect, which permits crack growth below the SIF threshold. In the present paper, crack growth in the VHCF regime is innovatively modeled and a general expression for the fatigue limit is then obtained.

In the present paper, microstructural and mechanical tests were carried out on AlSi10Mg samples manufactured by SLM technique in the XY building configuration. Homogeneous composition and typical microstructures were achieved for all the investigated samples. The mechanical properties were assessed through a tensile test and through the Impulse Excitation Technique (IET). The feasibility of ultrasonic Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) tests with Gaussian specimens characterized by large loaded volumes (risk-volumes) was also experimentally verified in the paper. A Gaussian specimen was designed and manufactured. A preliminary ultrasonic test was then carried out on the manufactured specimen and the fracture surface was finally investigated.

Generally, VHCF failures nucleate from internal defects characterized by a limited size. Unexpectedly, it has been found that cracks can grow from the initial defect even if the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is quite below the characteristic threshold for crack growth. Even though researchers unanimously accept this singular experimental evidence, they still dispute about its physical justification. Different micromechanical explanations have been proposed in the literature: local grain refinement, carbide decohesion, matrix fragmentation, hydrogen embrittlement, numerous cyclic pressure and formation of persistent slip bands are the most famous proposals. Regardless of the specific micromechanical explanation, it is generally acknowledged that a weakening mechanism occurs around the initial defect, thus permitting crack growth below the SIF threshold. The present paper proposes an innovative approach for the quantitative modeling of the weakening process around the initial defect. The proposed model considers an additional SIF that reduces the SIF threshold of the material. Starting from a very general formulation for the additional SIF, possible scenarios for crack growth from the initial defect are also identified and described. It is theoretically demonstrated that, depending on the scenario, a VHCF limit may also be present and its final formulation recalls the well-known expression previously proposed by Murakami. © 2017 EW MATERIALS.

Dynamic conditions related to the resonance of the vibrating specimen, contact nonlinearity between crack faces and stress singularity at the crack tip make the SIF computation difficult and cumbersome. Generally, numerical computation through Finite Element Models (FEMs) under non-linear dynamic conditions makes use of direct integration methods (implicit or explicit). However, in the high frequency regime of ultrasonic VHCF tests, the procedure may lead to an unacceptable computational time. In order to reduce the computational time, a hybrid procedure based on the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) and on the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) is originally presented and applied in this paper. The dynamic field parameters calculated with the HBM are used as input data for the computation of the SIF through the VCCT. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Paolino20161319" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">S-N curves in the very-high-cycle fatigue regime: statistical modeling based on the hydrogen embrittlement consideration</div> <div class="author"> D.S.

According to the √area model, the VHCF strength of high-strength steels can be estimated from the projected area of the ‘Optically Dark Area’ (ODA), which plays a key role in the VHCF response of high-strength steels: more than 95% of the total VHCF life is consumed in the ODA formation, with crack growing even though the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is below the threshold for crack growth.

They were originally designed by the Authors without considering the hysteretic damping and its effects on power dissipation: however, in order to evaluate the feasibility of ultrasonic fatigue tests with Gaussian specimens, hysteretic damping effects must be taken into account.

VHCF response of materials is therefore strongly affected by the defect population and, in particular, by the characteristic defect size, which statistically increases with the material volume. According to this well-known dependency, Size Effects were found to significantly affect the VHCF strength of high-strength steels. The paper aims at assessing the influence of Size Effects on the VHCF response of a high performance AISI H13 steel subjected to Electro Slag Remelting (ESR) refinement process. Ultrasonic VHCF tests were carried on specimens characterized by different loaded volumes (hourglass and Gaussian specimens). Experimental results showed that Size Effects strongly influences the VHCF response of the investigated high performance steel, even if it is characterized by a high degree of purity and by a population of inclusions with limited size.

In case of high-strength steels, VHCF failures generally originate from defects/inclusions present within the material and, consequently, the defect population properties (size and quantity) significantly affect the VHCF response of high-strength steels. Different refinement processes are commonly adopted in order to improve steel cleanliness: among the other, the ElectroSlag Remelting (ESR) process allows to obtain very clean high-strength steels, thus possibly inducing a significant enhancement of the VHCF response. The present paper aims at investigating the actual effect of the ESR process on the VHCF behavior of an AISI H13 steel. Fully reversed ultrasonic tension-compression tests are carried out on hourglass specimens manufactured with and without the ESR process. The estimated P-S-N curves highlight the positive effects of the ESR process on the VHCF response of the investigated H13 steel. © 2016 The Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Najafabadi201662" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Experimental-Numerical assessment of critical SIF from VHCF tests</div> <div class="author"> S.H.H.

In order to significantly reduce testing time, ultrasonic testing machines are widely adopted when carrying out VHCF tests. Several fundamental material properties can be estimated from the fracture surfaces of specimens failed during ultrasonic VHCF tests. In the VHCF literature, the critical Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is generally estimated by applying analytical SIF formulations to the typical semi-circular surface crack geometry revealed by fracture surfaces at final failure. However, when subjected to ultrasonic VHCF tests, analytical SIF formulations valid for static loading conditions could eventually lead to significant estimation errors. The present paper aims at comparing the critical SIF at failure estimated from conventional analytical formulations, and from Finite Element Models (FEMs). The fracture surfaces of two specimens with different shapes (Hourglass and Gaussian) are taken into account for modeling crack geometry at final failure. Through an implicit solving procedure, the critical SIF in resonance condition at 20 kHz is computed from the 3D geometry of the cracked specimens and compared with the corresponding analytical prediction. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello201649" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Different inclusion contents in H13 steel: Effects on VHCF response of Gaussian specimens</div> <div class="author"> A.

Classical fatigue life models based on a single failure mode and on the presence of the fatigue limit, have been integrated by models that can take into account the occurrence of two failure modes (duplex S-N curve). Duplex S-N models involve a number of unknown parameters that must be statistically estimated from experimental data. The present paper proposes a simplified and automated procedure for statistical parameter estimation. Parameter estimation is carried out by applying the Maximum Likelihood Principle and by taking into account the possible presence of runout specimens with unequal number of cycles. The procedure is applied to experimental datasets taken from the literature. The application of the procedure permits to estimate different key material parameters (e.g., the characteristic parameters of transition stress and fatigue limit), as well as to statistically predict the failure mode of each tested specimen. © (2016) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Paolino201531" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Statistical distributions of Transition Fatigue Strength and Transition Fatigue Life in duplex S-N fatigue curves</div> <div class="author"> D.S.

The needs of specific industrial fields (aerospace, mechanical and energy industry) for structural components with increasingly large fatigue lives, up to 1010 cycles (gigacycle fatigue), requested for a more detailed investigation on the experimental properties of materials in the VHCF regime. Gigacycle fatigue tests are commonly performed using resonance fatigue testing machines with a loading frequency of 20. kHz (ultrasonic tests). Experimental results showed that failure is due to cracks which nucleate at the specimen surface if the stress amplitude is above the conventional fatigue limit (surface nucleation) and that failure is generally due to cracks which nucleate from inclusions or internal defects (internal nucleation) when specimens are subjected to stress amplitudes below the conventional fatigue limit. Following the experimental evidence, the Authors recently proposed a new probabilistic model for the complete description of S-N curves both in the High-Cycle Fatigue (HCF) and in the VHCF fatigue regions (duplex S-N curves). The model differentiates between the two failure modes (surface and internal nucleation), according to the estimated distribution of the random transition stress (corresponding to the conventional fatigue limit). No assumption is made about the statistical distribution of the number of cycles at which the transition between surface and internal nucleation occurs (i.e., the Transition Fatigue Life TFL).In the present paper, the TFL distribution is obtained. The resulting distribution depends on the distance between the HCF and the VHCF regions and on the distribution of the random transition stress. It is also shown that the statistical distribution of the fatigue strength at the median TFL (i.e., the Transition Fatigue Strength TFS) has median which corresponds to the mean transition stress. Finally, a procedure for computing Likelihood Ratio Confidence Intervals (LRCIs) for both the median TFL and the median TFS is given in the paper. The estimated TFL and TFS distributions can be effectively used for properly choosing the duration of HCF tests in terms of number of cycles and the stress amplitude below which VHCF failures more probably occur. LRCIs for the median TFL and TFS can be usefully computed for assessing uncertainty in the estimation procedure when a limited number of experimental data is available.A numerical example based on an experimental dataset taken from the literature is provided. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Scattina20151867" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Prediction of cyclic fatigue life of nickel-titanium rotary files by virtual modeling and finite elements analysis</div> <div class="author"> A.

The objective of this study was to predict NCF and failure location of NiTi rotary instruments by FEM virtual simulation of an experimental nonstatic fatigue test. Methods ProTaper Next (PTN) X1, X2, and X3 files (Dentsply Maillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland) (n = 20 each) were tested to failure using a customized fatigue testing device. The device and file geometries were replicated with computer-aided design software. Computer-aided design geometries (geometric model) were imported and discretized (numeric model). The typical material model of an M-Wire alloy was applied. The numeric model of the device and file geometries were exported for finite element analysis (FEA). Multiaxial random fatigue methodology was used to analyze stress history and predict instrument life. Experimental data from PTN X2 and X3 were used for virtual model tuning through a reverse engineering approach to optimize material mechanical properties. Tuned material parameters were used to predict the average NCF and failure locations of PTN X1 by FEA; t tests were used to compare FEA and experimental findings (P &lt;.05). Results Experimental NCF and failure locations did not differ from those predicted with FEA (P =.098). Conclusions File NCF and failure location may be predicted by FEA.

Methods Thirty maxillary first permanent molars were selected. Mesiobuccal canals were randomly assigned (n = 15) to PG/PTN or SR/BR groups. Irrigation was performed with 5% NaOCl and 10% EDTA. Specimens were scanned (voxel size, 9.1 μm) for matching volumes and surface areas and post-treatment analyses. Root canal centering ability, canal geometry enlargement, and thickness of dentinal wall at inner curvature were assessed at apical level and point of maximum curvature. Results were analyzed with 4 one-way analyses of variance. Results Canal centering ability was superior in PG/PTN (P =.006 at apical level, P =.025 at point of maximum curvature). PG/PTN demonstrated a more conservative increase of canal areas (P =.027 at apical level, P =.038 at point of maximum curvature). Centrifugal increase in canal diameters did not significantly differ between groups (P =.65 at apical level, P =.61 at point of maximum curvature). Inner dentinal wall thickness was less reduced with PG/PTN compared with SR/BR, with no statistical differences (P =.23 at point of maximum curvature, P =.89 at apical level). PG/PTN shaping taper ranged between 6% and 7%. Conclusions Neither system produced significant shaping errors in curved canals. PG/PTN system showed better preservation of canal anatomy.

The null hypothesis was that direct restorations with fibre posts perform better than those without fibre posts. Methods Patients recruited for this study were treated in the Department of Cariology and Operative Dentistry, University of Turin, between 2008 and 2011. In total, 247 patients with 376 root treated posterior teeth, restored with direct resin composite, were recalled for a control visit. Only second-class cavities were considered. Two groups were defined based on the absence (Group A) or presence (Group B) of fibre post. Failures and complications, such as periodontal failure, endodontic failure, tooth extraction, root fracture, post fracture, post debonding, replacement of restoration, crown displacement, and coronal-tooth fracture, were noted. Functional restoration quality was evaluated following the modified USPHS criteria. Data were evaluated statistically with ANOVA. Results Group A consisted of 128 patients with 178 restorations (88 premolars, 90 molars) with a median follow-up of 34.44 months. Group B consisted of 119 patients with 198 teeth (92 premolars, 106 molars) with a median follow-up of 35.37 months. Direct restorations with fibre posts were statistically significantly more functional (95.12% success) than those without fibre posts (80% success) because of less marginal discolouration, better marginal integrity, and higher restoration integrity. Conclusions The null hypothesis was accepted because direct post-endodontic restorations with fibre posts performed better than restorations without posts after 3 years of masticatory function. Clinical significance An evaluation of the longevity of post endodontic direct restoration would seem to enhance the fiber post insertion within a composite restoration to reduce clinical failures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2015121" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">VHCF Response of AISI H13 Steel: Assessment of Size Effects through Gaussian Specimens</div> <div class="author"> A.

Methodology: Forty extracted premolars with oval canals were root filled, then randomly divided into four groups according to the post space preparation device and the shape of the luted fibre post: dedicated drill + round post, dedicated drill + oval post, ultrasonic tip + round post and ultrasonic tip + oval post. Posts were cemented with a self-adhesive cement (RelyX Unicem 2; 3M ESPE). Samples were sectioned in 1-mm-thick slices and observed under a microscope, and the area occupied by the post within the post space area was calculated. Bond strength was then measured using a push-out test, and the failure modes were evaluated with a stereomicroscope at 40× magnification. Fibre post adaptation and push-out test results were evaluated by analysis of variance (P &lt; 0.05). Results: Fibre posts, both round and oval, were better adapted to the apical region of the post space (P = 0.001). In oval canals, the bond strength was significantly higher in coronal regions, when the post space was prepared with a dedicated drill and an oval post was luted (P &lt; 0.0001). Adhesive failures between cement and post were the most frequent type of failure in all groups.

In order to evaluate the significance of size effects on the fatigue strength of materials, the Authors recently proposed to adopt Gaussian specimens for gigacycle tests. Fatigue specimens were designed without taking into account the hysteretic damping and its effects both on the stress distribution and on the heat power dissipation. However, in order to evaluate the temperature increment and the feasibility of ultrasonic fatigue tests with Gaussian specimens, the total dissipated heat power as well as the distribution of the dissipated heat power density along the specimen must be taken into account. The present paper proposes an analytical model validated through a finite element analysis, which permits to evaluate the effects of the hysteretic damping on the stress distribution, on the dissipated heat power density distribution and on the total dissipated heat power in Gaussian specimens. © 2014 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: 48 non-carious molars were selected and four Class-V cavities were prepared at the CEJ of each sample. Cavities were filled with Venus Diamond (Heraeus Kulzer); Venus Diamond Flow (Heraeus Kulzer) and Surefil SDR (Dentsply). Samples were divided into two groups: First group samples were immersed in a methylene blue solution for 30 min at 25°C. Second group samples were artificially aged and then treated with methylene blue. Samples were sectioned in the center of the restoration and observed with a 40x stereomicroscope, and the percentage of cavity infiltration was calculated. Results: Results were analyzed statistically by ANOVA (P &lt; 0.05). The amount of infiltration was significantly lower for the enamel substrate compared with dentin (P = 0.0001) and in samples immediately immersed in methylene blue compared with those that were artificially aged (P = 0.011). The interaction between the composite material and the marginal substrate significantly affected dye penetration (P = 0.006). Conclusions: Bulk fill flowable resins provided significantly better marginal seal in dentin, both before and after artificial ageing. Nanohybrid resin composites and bulk fill flowable resins showed similar microleakage values at enamel margins.

Main steps are provided to obtain the simulated distribution of the accumulated damage under variable amplitude loading. When the stochastic approach is applied in the presence of a random fatigue limit, an additional correlation structure, which takes into account the fatigue limit value, must be introduced in the analysis. If the number of cycles to failure under constant amplitude loading is Weibull (Log-Normal) distributed, then the corresponding accumulated damage is Fréchet (Log-Normal) distributed. The effects of the correlation structure on reliability prediction under variable amplitude loading are also investigated. To this aim, several experimental datasets are taken from the literature, covering various metallic materials and variable amplitude block sequences. The results show that the choice of the damage accumulation model is a key factor to value the improvement in the accuracy of reliability predictions introduced by the stochastic approach. Comparison of the predicted number of cycles to failure with experimental data shows that larger errors are non-conservative, regardless of the adopted correlation structure. When the analysis is limited to reliability levels above 80%, for these large non-conservative errors, it is the quantile approach to be closer to actual experimental data, thus limiting the overestimation of component’s life. For the experimental datasets considered in the paper, adoption of a stochastic approach would improve the accuracy of Miner’s predictions in 10% of cases. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Ltd.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tridello2014369" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Analytical design of gigacycle fatigue specimens for size effect evaluation</div> <div class="author"> A.

For this geometry the pioneering model is that of Lubkin and Reissner, Transactions of The ASME 78 (1956) 1213-1221, in which the tubes are treated as cylindrical thin shells subjected to membrane and bending loading, whilst the adhesive transmits shear and peel stresses which are a function of the axial coordinate only. Such assumptions are consistent with those usually adopted for the flat joints. A former investigation has shown that the L-R model agrees with FE results for many geometries and gives far better results than other models appeared later in the literature. The aim of the present work is to obtain and present an explicit closed-form solution, not reported by Lubkin and Reissner, which is achieved by solving the governing equations by means of the Laplace transform.

However, the residual wall thickness could be a valuable clinical parameter in the choice of restoration for endodontically treated teeth. Purpose The fracture resistance of endodontically treated premolars was compared with different wall thicknesses restored with direct composite resin with and without cuspal coverage and with and without fiber post insertion. Material and methods This study included 104 intact human maxillary premolars extracted for periodontal or orthodontic reasons. Standardized mesio-occluso-distal cavities were prepared with different palatal wall thicknesses (1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm) and a buccal wall thickness of 2 mm. Teeth were restored with or without a fiber post and with or without cuspal coverage. Specimens were subjected to thermocycling (3000 cycles, 5 to 55 C) and embedded in polymerized acrylic resin. Teeth were submitted to cyclic fatigue followed by a static fatigue test with a universal testing machine; a compressive force was applied 30 degrees to the long axis of the teeth until fracture. The results were statistically analyzed by 3-way ANOVA (α=.05). Results Residual wall thickness (P=.004), the type of adhesive restoration (P&lt;.001), and fiber post insertion (P&lt;.001) significantly influenced the fracture resistance of endodontically treated premolars. Conclusions In specimens with a cavity wall thickness &gt;2 mm, direct intracuspal composite resin restorations supported by a fiber post achieved comparable fracture resistance. With a residual wall thickness &lt;2 mm, only cuspal coverage with or without a fiber post provided satisfactory fracture resistance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Paolino2013316" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Sigmoidal crack growth rate curve: Statistical modelling and applications</div> <div class="author"> D.S.

The general case, in which more than two failure mechanisms coexist with the fatigue limit, has not been proposed yet. The paper presents a unified statistical model which can take into account any number of failure mechanisms and the possible presence of the fatigue limit.

Gigacycle fatigue tests, performed with ultrasonic fatigue testing machines, are commonly carried out by using hourglass shaped specimens with a small risk volume. The adoption of traditional dog-bone specimens allows for increasing the risk volume, even if the increment is quite limited. In order to obtain larger risk volumes, a new specimen shape is proposed (Gaussian specimen). The dog-bone and the Gaussian specimens are compared through Finite Element Analyses and the numerical results are validated experimentally by means of strain gages measurements.

Material and Methods: The conversion degree was monitored for 12 hours using Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) F-TIR Spectroscopy. The composite was placed in 1 or 2 mm rings and cured for 10 or 20 seconds with a LED lamp. ATR spectra were acquired from the bottom surface of each sample immediately after the initial photoactivation (P=0), 30 minutes (P=0.5) and 12 hours after photoactivation (P=12) in order to obtain the DC progression during the post-curing period. Interactions between thickness (T), irradiation time (I) and post-curing (P) on the DC were calculated through ANOVA testing. Results: All the first order interactions were statistically significant, with the exception of the T-P interaction. Furthermore, the shift from P=0 to P=0.5 had a statistically higher influence than the shift from P=0.5 to P=12. The post-curing period played a fundamental role in reaching higher DC values with the low-shrinkage composite resin tested in this study. Moreover, both the irradiation time and the composite thickness strongly influenced the DC.

Methods: Thirty ISO 15, 0.02 taper, Endo Training Blocks (Dentsply Maillefer) were used. In all specimens, the glide path was achieved with PathFile 1, 2, and 3 (Dentsply Maillefer) at the working length (WL). Specimens were then assigned to 1 of 2 groups for shaping: specimens in group 1 were shaped with ProTaper S1-S2-F1-F2 at the WL and specimens in group 2 were shaped with WaveOne Primary reciprocating files at the WL. Pre- and postinstrumentation digital images were superimposed and processed with Matlab r2010b (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA) software to analyze the curvature-radius ratio (CRr) and the relative axis error (rAe), representing canal curvature modification. Data were analyzed with one-way balanced analyses of variance at 2 levels (P &lt;.05). Results: The instrument factor was extremely significant for both the CRr parameter (F1 = 9.59, P =.004) and the rAe parameter (F1 = 13.55, P =.001).

In this study, micro-CT scanning was used to compare the ability of manual and mechanical glide path to maintain the original root canal anatomy. Methods: Eight extracted upper first permanent molars were scanned at the TOMOLAB station at ELETTRA Synchrotron Light Laboratory in Trieste, Italy, with a microfocus cone-beam geometry system. A total of 2,400 projections on 360° have been acquired at 100 kV and 80 μA, with a focal spot size of 8 μm. Buccal root canals of each specimen (n = 16) were randomly assigned to PathFile (P) or stainless-steel K-file (K) to perform glide path at the full working length. Specimens were then microscanned at the apical level (A) and at the point of the maximum curvature level (C) for post-treatment analyses. Curvatures of root canals were classified as moderate (≤35°) or severe (≥40°). The ratio of diameter ratios (RDRs) and the ratio of cross-sectional areas (RAs) were assessed. For each level of analysis (A and C), 2 balanced 2-way factorial analyses of variance (P &lt;.05) were performed to evaluate the significance of the instrument factor and of canal curvature factor as well as the interactions of the factors both with RDRs and RAs. Results: Specimens in the K group had a mean curvature of 35.4°± 11.5°; those in the P group had a curvature of 38°± 9.9°. The instrument factor (P and K) was extremely significant (P &lt;.001) for both the RDR and RA parameters, regardless of the point of analysis. Conclusions: Micro-CT scanning confirmed that NiTi rotary PathFile instruments preserve the original canal anatomy and cause less canal aberrations.

With the same bur the crown was separated into two parts along the midline vertically. At the end 96 "half-crowns" were obtained. The samples were divided into 6 groups of 8 samples each, according to enamel margin’s finishing technique (A and B: diamond ultrasonic tip; C: multisteel ultrasonic tip; D: fine diamond rotating bur; E: ultra-fine diamond rotating bur; F: sonicflex prep). The surface roughness evaluation of the enamel of each sample has been carried out by using a profilometer. The statistical analysis was performed with a balanced hierarchical ANOVA. The results of this in vitro study showed that the enamel roughness obtained with sonic and ultrasonic devices was significantly higher than roughness obtained with rotating burs.

In both groups, canals were shaped with WaveOne Primary reciprocating files at working length. Preinstrumentation and postinstrumentation digital images were superimposed and processed with Matlab r2010b software to analyze the curvature radius ratio (CRr) and the relative axis error (rAe), representing canal curvature modification.

Methods: Thirty-two root canals of permanent teeth were used. The angles of curvature of the canals were calculated on digital radiographs. The initial WL with K-files was transferred to the matched WaveOne Primary reciprocating files. After glide paths were established with PathFile (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), canals were shaped with WaveOne Primary referring to the initial WL. The difference between the postinstrumentation canal length and the initial canal length was analyzed by using a fiberoptic inspection microscope. Data were analyzed with a balanced 2-way factorial analysis of variance (P &lt;.05). Results: Referring to the initial WL, 24 of 32 WaveOne Primary files projected beyond the experimental apical foramen (minimum-maximum, 0.14-0.76 mm). A significant decrease in the canal length after instrumentation (95% confidence interval ranging from -0.34 mm to -0.26 mm) was detected. The canal curvature significantly influenced the WL variation (F 1 = 30.65, P &lt;.001). The interaction between the initial canal length and the canal curvature was statistically significant (F 2 = 4.38, P =.014). Conclusions: Checking the WL before preparation of the apical third of the root canal is recommended when using the new WaveOne NiTi single-file system. © 2011 American Association of Endodontists.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Belingardi20113279" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Investigation of influence of tab types on tensile strength of E-glass/epoxy fiber reinforced composite materials</div> <div class="author"> G.

Curves of the rate of growth of the DI in the steady phase (ΔDI/ΔN) vs. the normalised impact energy (ratio of the impact energy Ei and the laminate penetration threshold Pn) show no significant damage accumulation besides initial specimen indentation for impact energies below 0.2Pn. For intermediate levels of impact energy, repeated impact tests are characterised by an initial region of steady damage accumulation followed by an abrupt change in the rate of damage growth a few impacts before laminate perforation. For higher impact energies (Ei/Pn &gt; 0.4-0.45), no phase of steady damage accumulation is present, suggesting that severe damage mechanisms take place from the very first impacts. Values of the DI at the end of the steady phase (DIunsteady) are shown to be rather peculiar to each laminate regardless of the impact energy used in the tests and therefore may be used to get a first indication of the laminate performance to repeated impacts. The extent of the steady phase may also be used to compute the total energy absorbed by the laminate in the steady damage accumulation phase (EaTOT_steady). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

More recently, repeated impact tests carried out on thick laminates pointed out the significance and extent of the penetration process in thick laminates, which the DD is unable to monitor as, by definition, it reaches the value of one at penetration to remain unchanged over the entire penetration process. In the present paper, a new damage variable (damage index DI) is proposed to overcome shortcomings of the DD with respect to thick laminates. By introducing the displacement of the impactor into the definition of the DI, the depth of the penetration process is taken into account. Normalization by the displacement of the quasi-static perforation test allows for a non-dimensional damage variable which is shown to reach the value of one at perforation. Validity of the approach is proven against impact data obtained for different fibre-matrix architectures and laminate thickness. Results show that the DI can effectively differentiate between penetration and perforation thresholds, increasing monotonically within the range of the penetration process. In particular, the DI is shown to increase linearly with the impact energy up to penetration and to rise quite abruptly within the range of the penetration process. Results for repeated impact tests prove that at first the DI increases quite linearly impact after impact, owing to a steady accumulation of damage. A few impacts before penetration a sudden rise in the DI value points out a change in the rate of damage accumulation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The laminate is a thick non-symmetric glass-fiber-reinforced plastics intended for nautical application. Four impact velocities (1.5, 2.2, 3.1 and 3.8 m/s) were considered, and a minimum of four specimens for any given velocity were subjected to 40 repeated impacts or up to perforation.

Results point out that for impact velocities for which no perforation occurs within test duration, the experimental data essentially overlap. On the contrary, for perforation tests, HL specimens survived more impacts before perforating absorbing more total energy than VI specimens. Plots of the DI variable against the number of impacts were observed to exhibit an initial linear portion, owing to a stable process of damage accumulation within the laminate, and to undergo an unstable growth a few impacts before perforation. When comparing the VI and HL specimens it was observed that, given an impact energy, the level of damage at first impact as well as the rate of stable damage accumulation is alike for the two sets of specimens. On the contrary, it is the number of impacts of the stable damage accumulation region which is lower for VI specimens. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Finally, for the exponential distribution it is demonstrated that, if the number of failures can only be different from zero, confidence intervals based on the asymptotic properties of the likelihood estimators may give statistically meaningless results in the case of small sample size (3-10) and low probability of failure (.05-.20).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2006</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Belingardi2006345" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Vacuum infusion of a composite E-glass vinylester laminate for nautical application: Experimental response to repeated impacts</div> <div class="author"> G.

In a second part of the work, additional single impact tests were performed at 4.429 m/s and 6.264 m/s to investigate the laminate strain-rate sensitivity. Repeated impact tests pointed out that the delamination area grows very rapidly in the first few impacts to then level off, following closely the behaviour of the bending stiffness against the number of impacts. The value of the peak force increases in the first few impacts due to compaction and strain-hardening of the resin with a related decrease of the damage degree. Comparison between quasi-static penetration tests and impact tests demonstrates a strain-rate dependency of the laminate bending stiffness and first damage load.
