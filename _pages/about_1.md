Our research group, "Mechanics of Advanced Materials - Modelling and Testing," is at the forefront of innovation in structural applications using composites and metals. We excel in both experimental and numerical studies to design cutting-edge structures with these advanced materials.

In our experiments, we delve into quasi-static, crash, fatigue, and non-destructive testing, pushing the boundaries of material performance and reliability. Our state-of-the-art facilities enable us to simulate real-world conditions and extract critical data to inform our models.

On the numerical side, our expertise spans finite element analysis, statistical modeling, uncertainty quantification, mechanistic machine learning, and multiscale approaches. We develop sophisticated models that capture the complex behavior of materials under various conditions, ensuring our designs are both robust and efficient.

By integrating experimental insights with advanced modeling techniques, we strive to pioneer new solutions in the field of structural engineering, enhancing the safety, durability, and performance of next-generation materials.
