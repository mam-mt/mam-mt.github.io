abstract={This study presents a comprehensive exploration of the fatigue response in the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime for an additively manufactured (i.e., laser powder bed fused) A20X aluminum alloy. Although the need for high-performance materials with exceptional fatigue qualities has increased dramatically, the VHCF behavior of Al-Cu-Mg-Ag-TiB2 (A20X) structures remains largely unknown. A series of ultrasonic fatigue tests were performed to assess the prolonged fatigue life of the A20X alloy (in the VHCF domain where the number of cycles to failure is beyond 10 million cycles). The VHCF response, assessed through ultrasonic fatigue testing, was investigated by examining the stress-life (S-N) curves in a statistical framework, the fatigue crack initiation and propagation behavior, and the fracture surfaces. An asymptotic trend was experimentally found at 109 cycles, with a stress amplitude of 110 MPa for stress-relieved (SR) and 125 MPa for artificially aged (T7) materials, indicating the presence of an endurance limit. Furthermore, fracture surfaces showed the typical fisheye morphology, with a fine granular area (FGA) containing an internal crack-initiating site. The findings of this paper can assist in optimizing fatigue and durability design allowable for applications for extended fatigue life in the VHCF domains. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A novel method based on a physics informed data driven model is developed to design an origami composite crash tube. The structure consists of two axially stacked basic components, called modules. Each module presents lower and upper square sections with an octagonal section in the middle. The parameters of the octagonal cross-section and the height of each module are optimized to maximize the energy absorption of the tube when subjected to an axial impact. In contrast to standard surrogate modelling techniques, whose accuracy only depends on the amount of available data, a Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) scheme is adopted to correlate the crushing response of the single modules to that of the whole origami tube, constraining the data driven method to physically consistent predictions. The PINN is first trained on the results obtained with an experimentally validated Finite Element model and then used to optimize the structure. Results show that the PINN can accurately predict the crushing response of the origami tube, while consistently reducing the computational effort required to explore the whole design domain. Also, the comparison with a standard Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) shows that the PINN scheme leads to more accurate results. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={This paper deals with an innovative nondestructive technique for composites (local-IET), which is based on the Impulse Excitation Technique (IET) and, in the presence of damage, assesses the degradation of the elastic properties of a local region of the laminate by reversibly clamping its boundaries. In this paper, a numerical analysis of the sensitivity of the local-IET to the delamination damage mechanism is conducted. Firstly, a Finite Element (FE) model of the local-IET test is determined through experimental investigations on undamaged composite laminates, which cover a wide range and are made of glass or carbon fibers, through resin infusion or pre-preg consolidation and with unidirectional or fabric textures. The vibrational response of a glass fiber composite with local delamination is then assessed with the local-IET. By modeling the delamination in the simulation environment, the effectiveness of the FE model in replicating the vibrational response, even in the presence of delamination, is shown through a comparison with the experimental results. Finally, the FE model is exploited to perform a sensitivity analysis, showing that the technique is able to detect the presence of delamination. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={The scaling of the strength of composite parts with part size is referred to as the size effect. In the presence of notches, stress concentration affects a portion of material that increases with the notch size. Furthermore, in woven composites, the notch and tow size can be comparable, thus demanding a mesoscale approach to properly capture the stress intensification. In this paper, a probabilistic mesoscale method to model the size effect in notched woven composites is presented. First, the stress distribution is estimated with a finite element model, calibrated on experimental Digital Image Correlation data. The FE model simulates the mesoscale heterogeneity of the woven reinforced material and replicates the local stress intensification at the tow level. Then, a three-parameter Weibull-based statistical model is introduced to model the probability of failure from the calculated stress distribution and the volume of the part. An equivalent stress is used to capture the relevant fiber and matrix failure modes and the maximum value within the specimen volume is the random variable of the model. The method is applied to open-hole tension tests of a woven twill carbon fiber–epoxy composite. Two specimen widths and three width-to-diameter ratios, from 3 to 12, are considered. Specimen width produced an observable size effect, whereas the variation of hole size in the range considered did not. The statistical model is found to accurately describe the experimental observations, efficiently replicating an inverse size effect, regardless of hole size, while wider specimens lead to a lower probability of failure. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={The ultrasonic tensile test method recently developed by the Authors is applied with the micro-computed tomography technique aiming to correlate the failure-inducing nominal stress in alumina 99.5% with the manufacturing defect size. After characterizing the defect population, the critical defect size of each specimen is defined, and an empirical formulation for the stress intensity factors on this material is obtained. The ultrasonic tensile test, with a loading frequency of 20 kHz, is simulated with finite element analyses, to estimate with an optimization process the material properties that reproduce the experimental displacements. Evidence of negligible fatigue damage is verified to further support the validity of the ultrasonic tensile test as a method capable of providing a good estimate for the quasi-static tensile strength. The analysed alumina resulted in a density of 3969 kg/m3 and an elastic modulus of 371.2 GPa. All specimens failed in 100 cycles or less, with tensile strength values ranging from 79.5 MPa to 322.6 MPa. The reason for this large experimental variability is attributed to the dispersion of imperfection sizes, with critical sizes ranging from 92 μm to 3443 μm, proving the importance of combining the information on the defect population with the assessed tensile strength. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract={In the present work, the influence of defects on the compressive response of octet-truss AlSi10Mg lattice structure specimens produced with a selective laser melting process is investigated. The defect population in one cell, in two cells, and cubic specimens composed of 27 cells has been assessed with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analyses. The statistical distributions of the characteristic defect sizes, i.e., the equivalent diameter, the volume, and the surface, assessed in the lattice structure specimens and in volumes randomly extracted from a rectangular bar have been compared. Finally, the compressive behavior of lattice structure specimens has been simulated with a simplified damage-tolerant finite element model accounting for the influence of defects and compared with experimental results. The analyses have proven that the defect population in volumes extracted from a rectangular bar can provide reliable simulated results, even if micro-CT inspections of a unit cell or specimens made of several cells are suggested. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The study assessed the tensile, flexural, and impact properties of composite materials reinforced with flax fibers, employing three distinct resin types. The composite laminates were fabricated using three commercial resins: a conventional epoxy resin, an epoxy resin with a 31% weight concentration of bio-renewable content, and a recyclable methyl methacrylate infusion resin. This aims to assess if there exists a commercially available alternative to the traditional epoxy resin that can reduce the overall carbon footprint of composite materials. To investigate the influence of humidity on the mechanical behavior of the flax layers, a drying treatment was applied to the fibers before the infusion process. Micro-computed tomography analysis revealed that heat treatment resulted in a reduction of porosity, although it did not affect the mechanical response of the composite laminates. Moreover, laminates produced with non-recyclable and sustainable resins exhibited no significant change in tensile and flexural modulus. In contrast, those produced with recyclable resin demonstrated a slight reduction in the strengths of the composite laminates. Conversely, out-of-plane impact tests and repeated impact tests indicated that composites prepared with recyclable and bio-epoxy resin formulations present superior damage resistance to repeated impact compared to traditional epoxy resin. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={Singular stress fields represent a concern during the design of mechanical connections as they could trigger cracks within the joint, under low-amplitude loads, generating failures and reducing its service life. Appropriate design plans should therefore be implemented to produce more reliable apparatus. This paper explores the effects induced by both the presence and the absence of stress singularities on the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) performance of adhesively bonded butt joints through analytical, numerical, and experimental methods. Analytical models defined the conditions to design a stress singularity-free joint, global–local finite element descriptions studied the stress distributions in detail, and then VHCF experiments extracted S–N outcomes. The suitability of this approach is confirmed numerically while a substantial increase of the joint life is experimentally observed if the singularity is removed. Nonetheless, a non-singular configuration leads to higher scatter data compared to the original specimen configuration. © 2023 The Authors.

abstract={This paper proposes an innovative ultrasonic tensile test methodology for the assessment of quasi-static uniaxial mechanical properties and tensile strength of brittle materials. An ultrasonic testing machine, commonly employed for very high cycle fatigue tests, had its control and data acquisition systems adapted to induce specimen failure in about 100 cycles, avoiding cyclic load damage. The mechanical properties are thereafter estimated with a finite element model which simulates the experimental test. The proposed method has been validated by assessing the tensile strength of graphite R4550, characterized by brittle behaviour. The mechanical properties for graphite R4550 estimated with this experimental-numerical approach were found to be close to literature values obtained in different quasi-static testing configurations, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method and the feasibility of employing the ultrasonic fatigue testing machine for studying the behaviour of brittle materials. Furthermore, the proposed methodology eliminated issues caused by mechanical fixtures and tensile testing machine alignment, while also allowing a considerable increase of the material loaded volume when compared to that of traditional test methods. The experimental and numerical approaches are successfully validated on graphite R4550, also highlighting its capability of characterizing the material nonlinear behaviour, including viscoelasticity and asymmetrical response in tension and compression. © 2023},

abstract={In this study, the mechanical behavior of Single Lap Joints (SLJ) subjected to tensile loading was investigated both experimentally and numerically by considering different SLJ sizes including adherend thickness (T:0.88, 1.76, 3.52 mm), joint width (W:10, 20, 30 mm), and overlap length (L:10, 20 mm). A polyurethane adhesive and carbon fiber composite adherends were used for the experimental activity. The experimental campaign was carried out to assess the effects of the SLJ geometry on the mechanical behavior of SLJ. Further, SLJ tests were used to estimate the fracture toughness in mode I and II by using Finite Element methods (FEM) coupled with optimization analysis. The results showed that all three parameters strongly change the load capacity of the joints. According to the Experiments, for every sample configuration, the higher the adherend thickness the higher the adhesive shear and the lower the substrate normal stresses. Moreover, the width showed negligible effect on adhesive shear and substrate normal stresses. Numerically, the effect of geometric parameters has been analyzed once at relative 25% of ultimate load and once at a fixed load for each sample. At 25% of ultimate load, it was observed that the increase in the joint width has nearly no significant effect on adhesive shear and peel stresses. However, at a fixed common load increasing L, W, and T resulted in a decrease in adhesive shear and peel stresses. A good agreement was found between the experimental and numerical results. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Modern structures are designed to withstand in-service loads over a broad frequency spectrum. Nonetheless, mechanical properties in numerical codes are assumed to be frequency-independent to simplify calculations or due to a lack of experimental data, and this approach could lead to overdesign or failures. This study aims to quantify the frequency effects in the fatigue applications of a bi-material adhesive joint through analytical, numerical, and experimental procedures. Analytical and finite element models allowed the specimen design, whereas the frequency effects were investigated through a conventional servo-hydraulic apparatus at 5, 25, and 50 Hz and with an ultrasonic fatigue testing machine at 20 kHz. Experimentally, the fatigue life increases with the applied test frequency. Run-out stress data at 109 cycles follow the same trend: at 25 Hz and 50 Hz, the run-out data were found at 10 MPa, increasing to 15 MPa at 20 kHz. The P–S–N curves showed that frequency effects have a minor impact on the experimental variability and that standard deviation values lie in the range of 0.3038–0.7691 between 5 Hz and 20 kHz. Finally, the trend of fatigue strengths at 2·106 cycles with the applied loading frequency for selected probability levels was estimated. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={In this work, the strains measured with optic fibers and recorded during tensile tests performed on carbon/epoxy composite specimens were compared to those recorded by strain gauges and by Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The work aims at investigating the sensitivity of embedded and glued optic sensors for structural health monitoring applications in comparison with strain gauges and the full field strain map of the DIC. Acrylate, polyimide optic fibers, and three strain gauge sizes are considered to compare the three techniques. Results show hard polyimide-coated sensors are more sensitive to the material pattern than soft acrylate-coated fibers, which also require extensive adhesion length. The work shows a comparable size of strain gauges and material meso-structure is also critical for properly assessing material properties. The Young’s modulus computed with the three different techniques is used to define a strategy that supports the selection and the proper size of the adopted strain measuring system for structural health monitoring of composite materials. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive study on the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) characterization of a wire arc additive manufactured (WAAM) AWS ER100S-G steel. The demand for high-performance materials with superior fatigue properties has grown exponentially. However, the VHCF behavior of large-format WAAM'd structures remains relatively unexplored. In this study, a series of VHCF tests were conducted under fully reversed cyclic loading conditions to investigate the extended fatigue life (performance) of the WAAM ER100S-G steel. The VHCF properties, relative to conventional fatigue employing a servohydraulic testing system, of the WAAM ER100S-G steel were evaluated by analyzing the stress-life (S-N) curves, fatigue crack initiation, and propagation behavior, in a statistical framework, and the fracture surfaces. The results revealed the controlling mechanisms of VHCF failure of the WAAM ER100S-G steel and the fatigue response of the material beyond the conventional fatigue limit of 107 cycles. The findings provide valuable insights into the influence of WAAM-induced defects/microstructure on the extended fatigue performance of WAAM ER100S-G steel, which can aid in optimizing fatigue and durability design guidelines for additive manufacturing applications in high-cycle and very high-cycle fatigue domains. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The fatigue response of additively manufactured (AM) specimens is mainly driven by manufacturing defects, like pores and lack of fusion defects, which are mainly responsible for the large variability of fatigue data in the S–N plot. The analysis of the results of AM tests can be therefore complex: for example, the influence of a specific factor, e.g. the building direction, can be concealed by the experimental variability. Accordingly, appropriate statistical methodologies should be employed to safely and properly analyze the results of fatigue tests on AM specimens. In the present paper, a statistical methodology for the analysis of the AM fatigue test results is proposed. The approach is based on shifting the experimental failures to a reference number of cycles starting from the estimated P–S–N curves. The experimental variability of the fatigue strength at the reference number of cycles is also considered by estimating the profile likelihood function. This methodology has been validated with literature datasets and has proven its effectiveness in dealing with the experimental scatter typical of AM fatigue test results. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={In the present paper, two methodologies for the estimation of the design curves of datasets with failures originating from defects are proposed. With the first methodology, the Likelihood Ratio Confidence Bound of a specific quantile P-S-N curve is considered. The second method is based on the bootstrap approach, with a large number of datasets simulated starting from the stress life and the defect size distributions estimated from the experimental data. The two approaches have been validated on literature datasets covering also the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) life region, proving their effectiveness. © 2023 The Authors},

abstract={The aim of the present paper is to predict the fatigue life of Selectively Laser Melted (SLMed) Ti6Al4V components via the process parameters, the thermal treatments, the surface treatments and the stress amplitude, adopting machine learning techniques to reduce the cost of further fatigue testing, and to deliver better predictive fatigue designs. The studies resulted in reliable algorithms capable of predicting trustful fatigue curves. The methods have been trained with experimental data available in the literature and validated on testing sets to assess the extrapolation limits and to compare the different methods. The behavior of the networks has also been mapped by varying one SLM process parameter at the time, highlighting how each one affects the life. © 2023 The Authors.

abstract={It is widely known that defects in lattice structures weaken their mechanical response, resulting in premature failure and affecting their energy absorption capability. In this work an experimental–numerical methodology for the identification of the lower bound design curve of lattice structures subjected to quasi-static compressive and impact tests is proposed and validated on an octet truss lattice structure made of an additively manufactured AlSi10Mg alloy. The defect size distribution is assessed through micro computed tomography and retained in a Finite Element Model (FEM) simulating the mechanical tests by a local reduction of the truss diameter. As the location of critical defects affects the mechanical response, simulations are repeated for different random distributions of the defects within the specimen. Results show that the FEM can correctly predict the mechanical behavior of the lattice structure, with the experimental curves comprised within the band of numerical curves. The lower bound design curve to use for the safe design of components can be finally identified through statistical considerations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Since natural fibers have great potential as an alternative to synthetic fibers when the components are impacted at low energies, their mechanical properties under different types of loads need to be investigated. This can be accomplished by using finite element analysis, which is based on the definition of numerical models that reproduce the objects of the physical phenomenon under study. In defining these models, many parameters of the material cards are determined by experimental tests. However, experiments are time-consuming and costly, and it is not always possible to perform all the necessary tests to determine the values for all unknown parameters. For this purpose, the trial-and-error method is usually used. In this work, we present an optimization procedure for predicting the behavior of flax/epoxy composite laminates under low-velocity impact, using the LS-DYNA solver for numerical simulation. The study aims at identifying the values of relevant parameters that allow for predicting the experimental force–displacement trend as accurately as possible and reproducing the damage mechanisms numerically. Each step of the optimization flow is performed with the external tool LS-OPT, using dynamic time warping as a similarity measure to efficiently handle noise. For this purpose, we use the Efficient Global Optimization algorithm, a strategy based on surrogate modeling techniques. We address a multi-target scenario, i.e., we consider several energy levels simultaneously, aiming to find an optimal parameter configuration that is less sensitive to variations in impact energy. The results obtained not only demonstrate the potential of surrogate-based optimization to identify material parameters, but also provide a characterization of the studied composite configuration in view of future applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Multiscale analysis of composite laminates allows for predicting the mechanical response of these materials avoiding cumbersome experimental campaigns. The matrix and fibre material properties and the size of the Representative Volume Element (RVE) are the main parameters affecting the accuracy of multiscale models. This paper proposes a statistical inverse method to calibrate micromechanical material parameters from macroscale experiments and 3D reconstruction. First, glass fiber reinforced epoxy laminates have been analysed with Computer Tomography (CT), then, the material 3D microstructure has been reconstructed and fibre, matrix, and voids were segmented. Tensile tests have been performed on the composite specimen, measuring the surface strains with a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system. The reconstructed volume, converted to a voxel mesh, has been used to compute the homogenized response of composite by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. By comparing the marginal distribution of homogenized material stiffness extracted from DIC data of tensile tests, with the conditioned distribution computed by varying the FFT model parameter, a Stochastic Volume Element (SVE) is finally calibrated. A probabilistic multiscale model based on the SVE that propagates the uncertainty from the microscale to the structure level is presented. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, the fatigue design of AM components is addressed through Topology Optimization. Two defect-driven methodologies, which model the fatigue response in the finite life range and account for the experimental scatter, are compared. The first approach is based on the defect distribution and the marginal P-S-N curves. The second method models the size-effect by accounting for the stress distribution within the loaded material. The two approaches are used to assess the maximum allowable first principal stress, which causes crack propagation. As the fatigue strength depends on the component volume or the stress distribution, an iterative procedure is necessary to determine the optimal design. The optimal topologies of a cantilever beam and of an engine rod are determined and compared, showing that the defect-distribution method is the most conservative and the stress-gradient method can also be reliably applied in the case of uniform stress distribution, as in the engine rod. Furthermore, the choice of the volume to retain for the calculation of the fatigue strength in the defect-distribution method is critical. © 2023 The Authors.

abstract={In this paper, the influence of a blunt notch on the VHCF response of SLM Ti6Al4V specimens is investigated. Ultrasonic fully reversed tension–compression tests up to 109 cycles were carried out on unnotched specimens and specimens with a blunt notch. Unnotched specimens show a slightly larger fatigue response, with limited differences. All fatigue failures originated from defects, which are bigger in unnotched specimens, mainly due to the different risk volume of the tested specimens and the related size effect. Interactions between notch, stress gradient, and defect size distribution must be considered to properly assess the influence of notch on the VHCF response. © 2023 The Authors.

abstract={Mechanical testing of glass-fibre-reinforced composite (GFRP) plates made of twill fabric and a thermoplastic recyclable infusion resin is presented. The considered thermoplastic resin, ELIUM®, is made of poly-methylmethacrylate and can be infused with properly tuned vacuum techniques, in the same manner as all liquid resin. Tensile, flexural, and drop-dart impact tests were carried out to assess the mechanical properties of the composites considering different fabrication conditions, such as the different degassing pressure before infusion and three different infusion vacuum pressures. The work reports a methodology to infuse ELIUM resin at a relatively high vacuum pressure of 0.8 bar. X-ray microtomography analysis showed that the produced laminates are free of defects, differently from what was reported in the literature, where void problems related to a vacuum infusion pressure higher than 0.3–0.5 bar were pointed out. Vacuum pressure values influence the mechanical characteristics of the laminate: when higher vacuum pressures are adopted, the mechanical properties of the GFRP laminates are enhanced and higher values of elastic modulus and strength are obtained. On the other hand, degassing the resin before infusion does not influence the mechanical properties of the laminates. A maximum bending and tensile strength of 420 and 305 MPa were reached by using the vacuum infusion of 0.8 bar with an elastic modulus of 18.5 and 20.6 GPa, respectively. The density of the produced laminates increases at higher vacuum infusion pressure up to a maximum value of 1.81 g/cm3 with the fibre volume fraction of each laminate. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The effects of joint geometry parameters, such as adherend thickness (1.76, 3.52 mm), joint width (10, 20, 30 mm), and overlap length (10, 20 mm), on the behavior of single-lap joints (SLJs) under tensile loading are investigated in this study. Peak force, joint stiffness, shear stress, and normal stress are the investigated properties. SLJs are manufactured with carbon fiber composite adherends and two different types of adhesives, polyurethane and epoxy, which present a flexible and rigid mechanical response. The results showed that increasing all 3 geometric parameters (L, W, T) leads to a significant increase in the load capacity of polyurethane joints (on average, 88.4, 101.5, and 16.9%, respectively). For epoxy joints, these increases were 47.7, 100, and 46%, respectively. According to these results, W is the parameter with the most influence on the load capacity of the joints. However, it was observed that an increase in joint width has no significant effect on adhesive shear and a substrate’s normal stresses. Epoxy SLJs behave approximately elastically until failure, while polyurethane SLJ load-displacement curves include an initial linear elastic part followed by a more ductile behavior before the failure. Joint stiffness is affected by all the parameters for both adhesive types, except for overlap length, which led to a negligible effect on epoxy joints. Moreover, the damage surfaces for both types of joints are analyzed and the internal stresses (shear and peel) are assessed by using the analytical model of Bigwood and Crocombe. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The fatigue response of Additive Manufacturing (AM) components is driven by manufacturing defects - whose size mainly depends on process parameters - and by the resulting microstructure - mainly affected by heat treatments and process parameters. In the paper, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are applied to estimate the fatigue response from AM process parameters and heat treatment properties. Feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) and physics-informed neural network (PINN) algorithms are designed and validated on literature datasets of AM AlSi10Mg alloy, proving the effectiveness of physics-based ML approaches in predicting the fatigue response of AM parts. Leveraging PINN interpretability, the authors analyse the relationship between process parameters and fatigue response. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The uniaxial strength of 2 × 2 twill carbon fiber-epoxy composite with circular open holes is governed by the stress concentration induced by the notch, as well as by the variation of the material response with the stress localization. In this study, these concurrent phenomena were studied using an experimental-numerical approach, considering the effect of the composite heterogeneity. An innovative simplified mesoscale model using shell elements to replicate the woven pattern was developed. The material properties of the model were identified with a data-driven optimization scheme that minimizes the difference between the experimental full-field strain, measured with Digital Image Correlation, and the one predicted by the model itself. The elastic properties identified for the material at tow level are analogous to that of a unidirectional composite, with longitudinal and transverse moduli of around 102 GPa and 15 GPa, respectively. The calibrated model was used to analyze the stress concentration and localization induced by circular notches with increasing diameter. A size effect describing the increase in the carbon fiber tow strength following the increase in stress localization was observed. The mesoscale material strength was found to increase by about 2.5 times in the presence of the notch, from 2131 to 3922 MPa in fiber direction, partially balancing the stress intensification effect of the hole that leads to an approximately three-fold stress increase in the material. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The design against fatigue failures of Additively Manufactured (AM) components is a fundamental research topic for industries and universities. The fatigue response of AM parts is driven by manufacturing defects, which contribute to the experimental scatter and are strongly dependent on the process parameters, making the design process rather complex. The most effective design procedure would involve the assessment of the defect population and the defect size distribution directly from the process parameters. However, the number of process parameters is wide and the assessment of a direct relationship between them and the defect population would require an unfeasible number of expensive experimental tests. These multivariate problems can be effectively managed by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. In this paper, two ML algorithms for assessing the most critical defect in parts produced by means of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process are developed. The probability of a defect with a specific size and the location and scale parameters of the statistical distribution of the defect size, assumed to follow a Largest Extreme Value Distribution, are estimated directly from the SLM process parameters. Both approaches have been validated using literature data obtained by testing the AlSi10Mg and the Ti6Al4V alloy, proving their effectiveness and predicting capability. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The design against fatigue failures at very high number of cycles (VHCF) is fundamental to guarantee the integrity of components used in structural applications (aerospace, energy production, automotive). Experimental tests to assess the VHCF response of materials are generally carried out on small specimens with sizes that are significantly different from those of the components to be designed. Size-effect, which is widely known to affect the VHCF response, must therefore be properly modeled and accounted when components are designed to ensure their structural integrity. Size-effects in VHCF have been generally investigated by testing specimens with circular cross-sections and modeled by considering the probabilistic increment of the defect size with the loaded volume. In the present paper, ultrasonic fatigue tests have been carried out on hourglass flat specimens and larger dog-bone flat specimens to investigate size-effects. One aluminum alloy and four steels used for automotive applications have been tested. The experimental results have been analyzed with an innovative statistical model based on the weakest-link principle and on the stress gradient within the specimens, which does not require the size of the defect at the origin of the fatigue failure, generally not available if the specimen fails from the surface. Size-effects were found to significantly influence the VHCF response of the investigated materials, further confirming that it is strongly material dependent, even for flat specimens. A general rule for size-effect in VHCF of flat specimens was not found, proving that it must be properly experimentally verified and safely accounted when designing large components against VHCF failure.

abstract={In recent years, interest in sustainability has significantly increased in many industrial sectors. Sustainability can be achieved with both lightweight design and eco-friendly manufacturing processes. For example, concerns on the use of thermoset composite materials, with a lightweight design and a high specific strength, have arisen, since thermoset resins are not fully recyclable and are mainly petrol based. A possible solution to this issue is the replacement of the thermoset matrix with a recyclable or renewable matrix, such as bio-based resin. However, the mechanical properties of composites made with bio-based resin should be carefully experimentally assessed to guarantee a safe design and the structural integrity of the components. In this work, the quasi-static mechanical properties of composite specimens (eight layers of carbon fiber fabric) made with commercially available epoxy and a bio-based epoxy resins (31% bio content) are compared. Tensile tests on the investigated resins and tensile, compression, shear and flexural tests have been carried out on composite laminates manufactured with the two investigated resins. A finite element model has been calibrated in the LS-Dyna environment using the experimentally assessed mechanical properties. The experimental results have proven that the two composites showed similar quasi-static properties, proving that bio-based composite materials can be reliably employed as a substitute for epoxy resins without affecting the structural integrity of the component but lowering their carbon footprint. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The effects of the adhesive thickness and overlap of a polyurethane adhesive have been studied by using different substrate configurations. Single lap joint (SLJ) specimens have been tested with homologous substrates, carbon fibre-reinforced plastics and painted metal substrates. Furthermore, a configuration with dissimilar substrates has been included in the experimental campaign. Both types of these adhesive and substrates are used in the automotive industry. The bonding procedure has been carried out without a surface treatment in order to quantify the shear strength and stiffness when surface treatments are not used on the substrates, reproducing typical mass production conditions. Three different ageing cycles have been used to evaluate the effects on SLJ specimens. A finite element model that uses cohesive modelling has been built and optimised to assess the differences between the different adopted SLJ configurations. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={An experimental and numerical investigation on adhesive joints subjected to three different loading conditions (pure shear, combined shear-tensile load and pure tensile) has been carried out through the Arcan test. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of compliant substrates on the mechanical performances of the adhesive. Differently from traditional Arcan tests, where highly rigid substrates are used, U-shaped specimens made of carbon prepreg, final thickness 1 mm and 2 mm, have been bonded with a stiff epoxy and polyurethane adhesives. Nonlinear finite element analyses were performed to assess the stress state in the adhesives obtained by the experimental tests and showed a good correlation with the experimental results. In particular, the shear and tensile tests with the thicker substrates were used to determine the properties of the adhesives, while the 45° loading case combined with the thinner substrate results were used for validation. Results show that the compliance of the substrates significantly affects the fracture propagation of both adhesives in Mode I, as well as the maximum load of the epoxy-based joint for all the loading conditions. The results suggest that the Arcan test is suitable for the complete characterization of this type of adhesive joints. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This work investigates the coupled effect on mechanical and electrical properties of carbon black dispersed in polyamide 6 and 6.6 matrices. The CB content is varied between 15 % and 25 % wt. The elastic modulus increases of 12 % by increasing the CB concentration. Results reveal the capability of CB to functionalize thermoplastic polymers by activating conductive networks, as obtained over the percolation threshold of 13 % wt. The conductivity sensitivity to the mechanical strain is analyzed within direct (DC) and alternate current (AC) in the range of 0–100 kHz. Composite with lower CB concentrations exhibited a linear increase of the Gauge Factor (GF) with the frequency (from 2 to 4 at 20 %wt), while at 25 % wt of CB, the GF is 17 in DC regime and linearly decreases toward 6, at 100 kHz. A novel model for the estimation of the material Gauge Factor (GF) variation with the applied electric frequency is proposed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this chapter, the influence of manufacturing defects on the fatigue response of parts produced through Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes is investigated. Indeed, even in parts produced with optimized process parameters, the fatigue response can be worse than that of traditionally built (TB) components due to the presence of rare but very critical manufacturing defects. This chapter will focus on these rare defects that control the fatigue response.In particular, after a brief introduction on the defects which form during the AM processes, experimental fatigue datasets showing failures originating from defects are critically analyzed. The influence of process parameters and post-treatments is also investigated. Thereafter, the methodologies developed in the literature for modeling the influence of defects on the fatigue response are described. Finally, the design methodologies against fatigue failures from defects in AM parts currently available are described and compared, providing the reader with useful information for the assessment of the structural integrity of AM components. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The research on the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response of materials has gained increasing attention in the last few years. Indeed, the fatigue life of components has significantly increased and can exceed one billion of cycles in many industrial sectors, such as, automotive and aerospace sectors. Accordingly, to ensure a safe fatigue design and the structural integrity of components produced through traditional and additive manufacturing (AM) processes, experimental tests investigating also the VHCF life range should be carried out. In this chapter, a comprehensive analysis of the VHCF response of AM parts is carried out. Literature results obtained by testing AlSi12, AlSi10Mg, AlSi7Mg, Ti6Al4V, IN718, and 316L steel specimens are analyzed. The factors affecting the VHCF response of AM parts and the influence of defects are highlighted and discussed for the analyzed material. The main objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with an overview on the state of the art of the research on the VHCF response of AM parts, of utmost interest among the scientific community. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The fatigue behavior of Additive Manufacturing (AM) parts is influenced by manufacturing defects, whose dimensions are primarily determined by the parameters of the AM process, which, in turn, also affect the resulting microstructure, together with heat treatments. This study employs Machine Learning (ML) techniques to forecast the fatigue response of AM parts from the AM process variables and the heat treatment characteristics. Feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) and physics-informed neural network (PINN) models are formulated and verified employing published datasets on AM Ti6Al4V alloy. The results demonstrate that physics-based ML approaches are effective in forecasting the fatigue response of AM components. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In recent years, the European Community regulations are promoting the use of sustainable and green materials to lower the overall carbon footprint, especially in the automotive sector. The majority of structural composite materials use petrol-based epoxy matrices which are not easily recyclable, thus representing a negative impact on the environment. The most promising and ready-to-use technology to lower the carbon footprint in composite materials is the use of bio-based resins partially derived from renewable resources since this replacement is not affecting the manufacturing processes. Two commercial resins, a cardanol-based epoxy resin (27% bio-content) and an epoxy novolac resin (84% bio-content), were mixed to obtain four different resin mixtures. In particular, the higher bio-content novolac resin was mixed with the cardanol epoxy resin in different weight percentages to reach a total bio-content higher than 27%. The resins obtained by this procedure are characterized by total bio-contents of 27%, 31%, 41% and 51%, calculated on biomass used in production. Quasi-static and dynamic tensile tests have been carried out to assess the mechanical behavior of the different resins at increasing bio-contents. The strain has been acquired by using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system to determine the failure modes with respect to the bio-content. The tests have shown that the increase of bio-content lead to lower Young's modulus and lower ultimate strengths both decreasing with a linear trend in static and dynamic conditions. The glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of each mixture have been also studied by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analyses to assess the effect of the bio-content on the Tg values. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

abstract={Nowadays, in the global composites industry, an increasing number of companies are studying high-quality innovative and green solutions, in order to achieve the environmental sustainability goals. In this context, the use of a natural fiber reinforced polymer in the design of structural components needs to be validated through experimental mechanical tests. This study provides an overview of the behaviors of flax/epoxy and hemp/epoxy laminates subjected to tensile, four-point bending, and Low-Velocity Impact (LVI) tests, both from an experimental and numerical point of view. For each type of test, finite element models were simulated using the explicit code LS-DYNA in order to characterize the materials, reproduce the load-displacement plots, and analyze the damage evolution of the laminates. Two different types of mesh modeling were investigated for the models: shell and solid elements. In both cases, a proper contact modeling between layers was carried out to account for delamination phenomena of the material. The results obtained show an agreement between the experimental response and the simulated one, highlighting the possibility of designing and manufacturing structural components in composite material reinforced with natural fibers. © IMechE 2023.},

abstract={The industry's use of polymer composite materials is continuously increasing because of their excellent mechanical properties and light weight. However, among the multiple structural applications whose performance can be improved using composites, crashworthiness is one of the less common but with good perspectives for the future, thanks to the high level of energy absorption of these materials. In the present work, the crash behavior of three composite materials (a carbon/epoxy, a hybrid glass-carbon/vinyl ester and a carbon/vinyl ester laminate) was studied by performing in-plane compression tests of flat plates in impact conditions using a drop tower. The testing setup required a fixture to hold the specimen in vertical position and avoid buckling when loaded in in-plane direction. Two different versions of the testing fixture were compared. The first one requires a plate to transmit the load from the falling mass to the specimen, while in the second version the falling mass gets directly in contact with the specimen. The specimen crashed under the impact load, and the main failure mechanism was splaying with fronds. Both fixture versions worked effectively to crash the specimens and measure the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of the three materials. The carbon/epoxy and hybrid laminate showed a similar crash force, with the second having higher SEA because of the lower density. The carbon/vinyl ester material showed higher crash stress and SEA. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The elastic properties and the impact response of composite laminates made of carbon fibres (CFRP) and two different matrices, epoxy and bio-based epoxy, has been experimentally assessed with the Impulse Excitation Technique (IET) and with drop dart tests. Eight carbon twills (2 × 2) have been used to prepare the composite laminates with a traditional epoxy resin and an epoxy-based resin with 31% of bio content (glycerol in place of petroleum-based propylene). The elastic properties of the two investigated composite plates have been found to be slightly different, if assessed with the IET. Similarly, the resin type has been found to not influence the impact response, for impact energy equal to 15 J (dart rebound) and to 30 J (dart penetration). For the range of investigated impact energies, it can be concluded that the bio-based resin can be used in place of a commonly used epoxy resin. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the automotive sector, composite materials are gaining greater interest, in particular for application to car body components, thanks to their lightweight potential, which can lead to significant fuel consumption reduction and performance enhancement. In order to be suitable for automotive applications, fatigue properties have to be carefully investigated to properly design structural components. Having in mind the automotive application, a particular composite material, a polyamide reinforced with 18%wt short glass fibres, has been considered. Uniaxial fatigue tensile tests with load ratio R = 0.1 were carried out on flat specimens made of the selected material. The experimental tests were performed using a hydraulic fatigue testing machine, in stress-controlled mode, with a loading frequency in the range of 0.5–3 Hz depending on the stress amplitude. P-S-N curves and endurance limit were determined according to the ISO standard 12107. Moreover, an innovative approach based on the Maximum Likelihood Principle (MLP) was used to estimate the P-S-N curves as well as the endurance limit. Obtained results showed that the estimation made with the MLP, reduces the total time of the test campaign and data fitting is more effective. Moreover, the material tested exhibits interesting properties for automotive applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The maximum likelihood principle is exploited for parameter estimation, thus allowing to consider both failures and runout specimens. A straightforward procedure for the estimation of the design curves based on the likelihood ratio confidence lower bound has been also developed. The proposed model has been validated with literature datasets obtained by testing steel and aluminum alloys, proving its effectiveness and representing a reliable alternative to the currently adopted literature models. © 2023 The Authors.

abstract={In this paper, a generalized formulation of defect-driven topology optimization (TO) for fatigue design, named TopFat, is proposed, where the first principal stress, that causes the crack propagation, is limited in accordance with the defect size distribution of the additive manufacturing (AM) process. As the largest defect depends on the final volume of the component, which changes according to the topology, an iterative procedure is adopted to avoid volume constraints in the optimization problem. The procedure is applied to an actual aerospace bracket component and its strength and limitations are discussed in comparison with the TO formulations presented in the literature. Results show that considering the defect population significantly affects the final topology, while leading to a feasible optimum. Further, even though the computational time increases, an additional 15% of mass saving is achieved by adopting the proposed iterative procedure with respect to a volume constraint-based formulation of TopFat. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Size effects concern the anomalous scaling of relevant mechanical properties of materials and structures over a sufficiently wide dimensional range. In the last few years, thanks to technological advances, such effects have been experimentally detected also in the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) tests. Research groups at Politecnico di Torino are very active in this field, observing size effects on fatigue strength, fatigue life and fatigue limit up to the VHCF regime for different metal alloys. In addition, different theoretical models have been put forward to explain these effects. In the present paper, two of them are introduced, respectively based on fractal geometry and statistical concepts. Furthermore, a comparison between the models and experimental results is provided. Both models are able to predict the decrement in the fatigue life and in the conventional fatigue limit. © 2022 by the authors.},

The approximate Owen with the staircase method, a method based on the likelihood ratio confidence interval, and an original method based on the bootstrap approach are considered. Three experimental datasets are employed for the experimental validation, showing that the three methods permit to have a reliable estimation of the design curves and that the number of data and, accordingly, the test duration can be significantly reduced with the proper testing strategy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this work, the assessment of the residual elastic response in damaged woven laminates is addressed through an innovative nondestructive technique. Based on the Impulse Excitation Technique (IET), the goal is to determine the local variation of the elastic properties through local vibrational tests. In particular, by non-destructively clamping its extremities, the vibrational response of the region of interest can be isolated and a vibrational mode can be excited, which depends only on the material properties of the inspected region. In presence of damage, the local degradation of the elastic response can be then correlated to the decrement of the first resonant frequency. The technique is applied to glass-fibre/epoxy laminates damaged by impact and its sensitivity to the size of the inspected region is investigated through three clamping devices of different dimensions. For validation, tensile tests are performed on specimens cut from the impacted plates, where the axial deformation is punctually measured through optic fibre glued along the specimen axis. Results show that the residual elastic properties assessed with the proposed technique are in very good agreement with those measured through the optic fibre, thus proving the effectiveness of the methodology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper experimentally investigates the effect of the specimen volume (size-effect) on the Very-High-Cycle-Fatigue (VHCF) response of SLM AlSi10Mg specimens. Tension-compression tests are carried out on hourglass and Gaussian specimens with different risk-volumes produced in horizontal and vertical direction. Experimental results show that size-effects significantly influence the VHCF response regardless of the building orientation. Furthermore, size-effects are more evident for SLM specimens than for traditionally built specimens, pointing out that the design of SLM components cannot rely on the results obtained by testing traditionally built specimens. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Plasma treatment has been used in recent years to activate the surfaces of adhesive substrates and thus as an adhesion promoter between adhesive and substrates. The use of plasma treatments is widely adopted in the automotive industries especially for polymers that present low surface energy, such as polypropylene. In this work, polypropylene substrates used in the automotive industries have been treated with two different techniques: vacuum and atmospheric plasma. Then, polyurethane and methacrylate adhesives have been used to bond single lap joints (SLJs). Typically, these two adhesives cannot bond polypropylene substrates without surface treatments. An experimental plan has been designed to investigate the process parameters that can increase the functional polar groups (FPGs) maximizing the adhesion strength. Besides the types of plasma, two different gas carriers (air and nitrogen) and different treatment times have been investigated. The substrates, treated and not treated, have been assessed through scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to quantitatively assess the increment of FPGs after the different treatments. The experimental plan shows that the atmospheric plasma can improve the surface of the substrates by using a smaller time. Mechanical tests on SLJs show that methacrylate and polyurethane cannot bond polypropylene substrates without the plasma treatment. On the other hand, the treated substrates can form a strong bonding with the adhesive since all SLJs exhibit a substrate failure. Mechanical tests have been also carried out after three different aging cycles showing that the adopted plasma treatment is not affected by the aging cycles. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={In this work, an experimental and numerical analysis of a lattice structure for energy absorption was carried out. The goal was to identify the most influencing parameters of the unit cell on the crushing performances of the structure, thus guiding the design of energy absorbers. Two full factorial plans of compression tests on cubic specimens of carbon nylon produced by fused deposition modeling (FDM) were performed. The factors were the beam diameter and the number of unit cells. In the first factorial plan, the specimen volume is constant and the dimensions of the unit cell are varied, while the second factorial plan assumes a constant size of the unit cell and the volume changes in accordance with their number. The results showed that the specific energy absorption increases with the diameter of the beam and decreases with the size of the unit cell. Based on these results, a crash absorber for the segment C vehicle was designed and compared with the standard component of the vehicle made of steel. In addition to a mass reduction of 25%, the improved crushing performances of the lattice structure are shown by the very smooth force-displacement curve with limited peaks and valleys. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The diffusion of fiber reinforced plastics in crashworthiness applications is continuously growing thanks to the excellent balance between high mechanical performances and low weight, resulting in most cases in a Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of composite structures higher than that of the corresponding metallic structures. In this paper, a new fixture to test composite plates applying an in-plane load has been used to investigate the effect of the impact velocity and of the friction caused by the fixture on the SEA of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy plates. The tests have been carried out using a drop tower testing machine and the effect of the friction has been studied varying the clamping force given by the fixture. Splaying is the main failure mechanism found in the specimens during the tests; SEA values (43.6 kJ/kg in average) increase with the clamping force due to the higher friction level induced by higher clamping force; impact velocity does not significantly influence the results. To avoid an overestimation of the SEA due to the excessive friction force (+5.6% when the clamping force increases from 0.8 kN to 8 kN), a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating has been applied to the anti-buckling supports to reduce the friction. The effect of this modification has been studied by carrying out a new test in which the specimen slides between the anti-buckling supports with a given clamping force. A significant reduction (-48% with same clamping force) of the friction force is obtained when the lubricant is applied. © 2021},

abstract={The research on the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response of materials is fundamental to guarantee a safe design of structural components. Researchers develop models for the fatigue life in VHCF, aiming at assessing the stress–life relation and, accordingly, the probabilistic S–N (P-S–N) curves. In the paper, the models for the stress–life relation in VHCF are comprehensively reviewed. The models are classified according to the approach followed for defining the stress–life dependency, that is, power law, probabilistic, fracture mechanics, or Paris law-based approach. The number of failure modes that can be modeled, the statistical distribution for the fatigue life, and the characteristics of the estimated P-S–N curves are also reviewed by analyzing the fitting capability of experimental datasets for each model. This review is supposed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the currently available models and guide the future research. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The present paper investigates the influence of AM defects on the energy absorption capability of lattice structure specimens made of carbon nylon. Two typologies of defects are considered through numerical simulations: i) the variation of the diameter of the beam with respect to the nominal value; ii) the presence of lack-of-fusion portions of material within the beams. The defects are randomly disposed in the unit cell and different defect populations are then simulated. Transient nonlinear finite element analyses of the lattice structure subjected to compression tests are performed in the LS-Dyna environment. The numerical model is validated with experimental data collected in a previously published work. Results show that both beam diameter variations and lack-of-fusion defects affect the absorbed energy although with different severities. The increasing degradation of the absorbed energy with the increasing numerosity of the defects confirms the necessity of accounting for these defects when designing lattice-based energy absorbers. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Probabilistic-S-N (P-S-N) curves are commonly employed to model the fatigue response of specimens and components and are generally obtained by assuming the statistical distribution of the fatigue life. In industrial applications, starting from the P-S-N curves, the so-called “design curves” or “lower bound S-N curves” are defined for the design of components, in order to ensure a safety margin against fatigue failures. Due to the growing interest in the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response of materials, methodologies for the estimation of the design curves should not be limited to the Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF)-High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) life range but should also cover the VHCF region. In this work, the Maximum Likelihood Principle is exploited for the assessment of the design curves of datasets obtained through tests in the LCF-VHCF range, with the P-S-N curves showing a duplex trend. First, the model for the P-S-N curves with duplex trend is defined. Then the proposed methodology for the design curves is described and finally validated with literature datasets. © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Fiber reinforced plastics are employed in structures for crashworthiness applications thanks to their high Specific Energy Absorption (SEA), which permits a significant reduction of weight and noxious vehicle emissions. In these structures it is important to have a geometric feature, known as failure trigger, to locally reduce the strength and initiate a stable crash failure avoiding excessive peak forces and instabilities. This is of particular importance for specimens dedicated to material characterization. In this study, triggers of six different geometries were machined on flat specimens made of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy. Crash tests were performed using a fixture developed to avoid the buckling of the plate loaded in the in-plane direction in quasi-static and impact loading conditions. Test results showed a strong effect of the trigger in the first part of the load-displacement curve (failure initialization). No effect was found in the steady crash region, where the force was approximately constant in all the tests. No significant influence of the trigger type was therefore detected on the SEA evaluation. © 2022 Vigna et al.},

abstract={It is well-known that fatigue failures in VHCF originate from defects present within the risk-volume. Moreover, experimental results have shown that the larger the specimen size and the risk-volume, the shorter is the VHCF life. This is known as size-effect and is generally due to the statistical increment of the defect size with the material volume. In the paper, size-effect in VHCF is critically revised. The experimental results obtained by testing specimens with different sizes are analyzed and the methodologies proposed to model size-effect are discussed, with the aim of guiding the future research on size-effect in VHCF. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This work aims to study the healing potential properties of a reversible thermoplastic adhesive. The adhesive is activable by using induction heating systems that can induce thermal heat in the particles throughout the electromagnetic field so they can melt the adhesive for bonding or separation procedures. The healing procedure consists of damaging single lap joint (SLJ) specimens with quasi-static and fatigue tests and then using an inductor to generate an electromagnetic field able to heat the adhesive to its melting point in order to heal the damaged SLJ specimens. SLJ tests were performed on damaged and healed specimens to assess, respectively, the residual mechanical properties of the damaged specimens and the mechanical properties after healing. SLJ tests showed that the healing procedure can completely recover the joint stiffness of the damaged adhesive joints, a huge part of the maximum shear strength and the SLJ absorbed energy. This work shows also the possibility of re-bonding completely failed or separated SLJs by using the same procedure. The mechanical properties of SLJs after healing and re-bonding are compared to the SLJ compared on virgin specimens to assess the recovered mechanical properties. © 2021 by the author.

abstract={The aim of this in vitro study is to evaluate the effect of different acidic media on volumetric wear and surface roughness of CAD/CAM monolithic materials. Forty-eight rectangular specimens were prepared using different CAD/CAM monolithic materials: nanohybrid composite (Grandio Blocks, Voco), resin-based composite (Cerasmart, GC), lithium disilicate (E-Max, Ivoclar), and high-translucency zirconia (Katana STML, Kuraray Noritake). After storage in distilled water at 37◦ C for two days, the specimens were tested using a chewing machine with a stainless-steel ball as an antagonist (49N loads, 250,000 cycles). Testing was performed using distilled water, Coca-Cola, and Red Bull as abrasive media. Wear and surface roughness analyses of the CAD/CAM materials were performed using a 3D profilometer and analyzed with two-way analysis of variance and post hoc pairwise comparison procedures. Worn surfaces were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Resin-based materials suffered higher volumetric wear than ceramics (p = 0.00001). Water induced significantly less volumetric wear than the other tested solutions (p = 0.0014), independent of the material tested. High-translucency zirconia showed less surface roughness than all the other materials tested. The selection of monolithic CAD/CAM materials to restore worn dentition due to erosive processes could impact restorative therapy stability over time. Resin-based materials seem to be more influenced by the acidic environment when subjected to a two-body wear test. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The development of damage tolerance strategies in the design of composite structures constitutes a major challenge for the widespread application of composite materials. Damage tolerance approaches require a proper combination of material behavior description and nondestructive techniques. In contrast to metals, strength degradation approaches, i.e., the residual strength in pres-ence of cracks, are not straightforwardly enforceable in composites. The nonhomogeneous nature of such materials gives rise to several failure mechanisms and, therefore, the definition of an ulti-mate load carrying capacity is ambiguous. Nondestructive techniques are thus increasingly re-quired, where the damage severity is quantified not only in terms of damage extension, but also in terms of material response of the damaged region. Based on different approaches, many nonde-structive techniques have been proposed in the literature, which are able to provide a quantitative description of the material state. In the present paper, a review of such nondestructive techniques for laminated composites is presented. The main objective is to analyze the damage indexes related to each method and to point out their significance with respect to the residual mechanical perfor-mances, as a result of the working principle of each retained technique. A possible guide for future research on this subject is thus outlined. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The fatigue response of additive manufactured (AMed) components is generally controlled by the defect population, and the models for assessing the fatigue response of AMed parts have to take into account the distribution of defect size and the intrinsic scatter associated to the fatigue response. In the present paper, a statistical methodology for analyzing the results of tests on AMed specimens failed due to cracks originating from defects is proposed. The procedure involves the estimation of the distribution of the fatigue life, which is considered dependent on the applied stress amplitude and on the defect size. Thereafter, all the experimental failures are shifted at a reference number of cycles to failure or stress amplitude, making it possible to compare data obtained at different stress levels or number of cycles to failure. The proposed method has been successfully validated on literature dataset, proving its effectiveness and general validity. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={In this work, the mechanical characterization of adhesive joints made with a thermoplastic adhesive, modified and not modified, has been presented together with the separation tests that are possible by the use of metal nanoparticles embedded within the adhesive. A polyolefin adhesive has been modified with two weight concentrations (5% and 10%) of iron oxide nanoparticles. These particles increase their temperature under electromagnetic field; in this way, they are able to melt the adhesive and, therefore, separate the adhesive joints. The mechanical properties of single lap joints (SLJs) prepared with the neat and modified adhesives have been performed by using different overlap lengths and thicknesses. SLJs prepared with the nanomodified adhesive present higher loads compared with the neat one. Separation tests have been carried out on SLJ specimens to measure the times needed to disassemble the adhesive joints. Scanning electron microscope analysis has been carried out to study the distribution of the particles. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={A thermoplastic adhesive modified with iron oxide particles (IO) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) has been used to ease the dismounting process of plastic component assemblies by using microwave or induction heating systems. GNPs have been added to an adhesive already modified with iron oxide particles (10% in weight) to melt the adhesive and separate adhesive joints in a more rapid and efficient way compared to the adhesive preliminarily adopted by the same authors. The IO-based thermoplastic adhesive was modified with three different GNP weight concentrations, namely 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%. The mechanical properties have been evaluated through single lap joint (SLJ) tests. These tests showed that the maximum sustained load and the elastic moduli of the joints increase together with the increase of GNP percentages. Microwave or induction heating tests conducted on all the adhesive compositions showed that it is possible to melt the adhesive rapidly and thus separate the plastic joints in a very rapid way, 14 s, and 10 s respectively for the cases that embed 1% of GNPs. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the extruder can mix uniformly these particles without the formation of agglomerates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the present study, a novel defect-driven topological fatigue (TopFat) optimisation approach is proposed. The influence of defects on the fatigue strength is modelled by using the Murakami formulation to consider the defect distribution in the material. The fatigue strength is taken into consideration by introducing a stress constraint in the minimum compliance topology optimisation problem in addition to the von Mises stress and volume constraints. The algorithm has been effectively validated on several literature cases, providing optimized topologies with maximised stiffness under the prescribed quasi-static and fatigue strength requirements. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A novel statistical approach to model size effects in very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) is proposed in the paper. The statistical distributions of the VHCF life and of the size of the defect leading to VHCF failure (critical defect) are identified in the paper through the weakest-link principle. The statistical distributions are able to account for the stress gradients that are present in a loaded material volume. An efficient procedure for estimating the parameters involved in the statistical distributions is also shown. The proposed statistical models are finally validated through experimental data taken from the literature. The experimental validation proves the fitting capability of the proposed models that outperform the traditional models based on the 90% risk-volume. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, an integrated method for the design of suspension components with lightweight materials is proposed. Starting from the well-established design flow for chassis components, the paper analyse the manufacturing and design aspect which are mutual dependent in composite structures, providing technical guidance. The proposed design methodology is applied to an innovative suspension archetype patented by Magneti Marelli, F.L.E.C.S. (Flexible Link Elevated Compliance Suspension). First, an analysis of available lightweight material is carried out to define which one best fits the design requirements in terms of density, stiffness, cost and manufacturability. Second, structural simulations, based on finite element analysis, are performed to investigate the influence of the thickness and material on the elasto-kinematic performance of the suspension. According to the stress distribution, an optimization of the shape and the stacking sequence of the component is performed. The results show that 8.5 mm carbon fibre reinforced epoxy is the best solution for the blades, and 5 mm aluminium alloy for the reinforcement tube wall thickness. Third, with respect to the final design, an adhesive interface is analysed and designed, using the Goland-Reissner model. © IMechE 2020.},

abstract={An innovative experimental methodology for the nondestructive assessment of local elastic properties of composite materials is proposed in this paper. A local region of rectangular shape is isolated on the investigated laminate with a proper clamping system. The first resonant frequency of the retained region with clamped boundaries is determined through the Impulse Excitation Technique. In order to take into account the anisotropy of the composite laminate, values of the resonant frequency are measured after rotating the clamping system with respect to the composite plate. The material constants are finally obtained from the measured frequencies through an inverse optimization algorithm based on Finite Element analysis. The proposed methodology is validated on a unidirectional composite plate with known elastic properties. Boundaries of the investigated region are clamped by pressing two rectangular frames to the plate through a testing machine, thus localizing the measure of the resonant frequencies. The first resonant frequency is measured at different angles (0°, 30°, 60° and 90°) between fibers direction and main axis of the rectangular region. Dynamic elastic properties are finally assessed through the proposed inverse optimization algorithm. The small differences between the nominal and the estimated mechanical properties prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The detection and evaluation of damage in composite materials components is one of the main concerns for automotive engineers. It is acknowledged that defects appeared in the manufacturing stage or due to the impact and/or fatigue loads can develop along the vehicle riding. To avoid an unexpected failure of structural components, engineers ask for cheap methodologies assessing the health state of composite parts by means of continuous monitoring. Non Destructive Technique (NDT) for the damage assessment of composite structures are nowadays common and accurate, but an on-line monitoring requires properties as low cost, small size and low power that do not belong to common NDT. The presence of a damage in composite materials, either due to fatigue cycling or low-energy impact, leads to progressive degradation of elastic moduli and strengths. Since there is a well-known relationship between the elastic modulus reduction and the amount of damage, the stiffness degradation can be used for the scope of detecting the position and the amount of damage that has taken place. Relying on these concepts, a novel strain-based damage sensing procedure is here proposed, that can identify damages in composite structures by processing strain measures from a distributed sensors network. To achieve this result a combined Machine Learning pipeline, composed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and One Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) is proposed. First, PCA learns a linear transformation on the undamaged measurements to reduce the data dimensionality; secondly, OC-SVM trained to detect anomalies in the projected components. A cross-validation procedure is used to find the optimal pipeline configuration. The methodology is virtually tested on a carbon fiber suspension. The results suggest dropping the first components of the PCA to feed the classifier. In addition, results show the capability of the algorithm to detect anomalies in the component strain response. © 2021 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, a model for the assessment of size effects on quasi-static strength of brittle materials subjected to applied load inducing a nonuniform stress distribution within the material volume is proposed. An equivalent stress computed through finite element analysis is introduced in the model to account for the effect of the stress gradient within the loaded volume. The defect size distribution is modelled, differently from the literature, with the largest extreme value distribution. The proposed model has been validated with datasets available in the literature and obtained through bending tests on concrete specimens. For each type of test, the model permits to properly assess size effects. Due to its general formulation, a model for the strength variation with respect to the loaded volume, regardless of the testing type, was also obtained, further proving its effectiveness. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={In the last few years, the rapid diffusion of components produced through additive manufacturing processes has boosted the research on design methodologies based on topology optimization algorithms. Structural topology optimization is largely employed since it permits to minimize the component weight and maximize its stiffness and, accordingly, optimize its resistance under structural loads. On the other hand, thermal topology optimization has been less investigated, even if in many applications, such as turbine blades, engines, heat exchangers, thermal loads have a crucial impact. Currently, structural and thermal optimizations are mainly considered separately, despite the fact that they are both present and coupled in components in service condition. In the present paper, a novel methodology capable of defining the optimized structure under simultaneous thermomechanical constraints is proposed. The mathematical formulation behind the optimization algorithm is reported. The proposed methodology is finally validated on literature benchmarks and on a real component, confirming that it permits to define the topology, which presents the maximized thermal and mechanical performance. © IMechE 2020.},

abstract={The high-cycle and very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) behavior of AlSi10Mg specimens manufactured by selective laser melting with different printing powder sizes was investigated. The specimens with 20 μm powder size contained more defects than those with 50 μm powder size, and the latter have a higher fatigue property than the former. Unmelted powders were detected as the main source of crack initiation. The specimens printed with 50 μm powder size are more likely to feature subsurface crack initiation in the VHCF regime. Five different types of crack initiation modes were identified, and the fatigue strength was assessed by statistical model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In particular, the crash boxes must guarantee a progressive and controlled energy absorption, avoiding peak of force (and thus acceleration) that can lead to passenger injury. In recent years, crash boxes made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) have found application in the automotive sector. However, their brittle failure mode leads to an irregular crushing trend characterized by peak of force. Thereafter, the crushing behaviour of the composite material structures can be improved by modifying their geometrical parameters. Among the most promising solutions, the origami structure is increasingly considered for crash boxes. The origami crash box here considered consists of four axially stacked basic structures. Each basic structure is composed of four trapezoidal faces and four triangular faces. The upper cross section is squared, whereas the lower cross section has an octagonal shape. The structural behaviour of the origami component was investigated according to different sizes of the triangular faces. The numerical models were simulated with the finite element commercial code LS-Dyna in its explicit formulation. The optimal shape of the origami structure in terms of maximum energy absorption and limited force peak was defined in LS-OPT environment. The objective function of the shape optimization algorithm was set to maximize the energy absorption, while limiting the peak of force. The optimal shape defined presented larger sizes in the top basic structures than in the bottom parts, resulting in more inclined faces. The result suggested that more inclined faces in the top part can guarantee a fracture-triggering effect in the crash box, which ensured a smaller peak force. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques for metal alloys, such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Electron Beam Melting (EBM), experienced significant improvements in terms of process speed, cost reduction and overall repeatability. For this reason, the use of AM components has significantly increased. Moreover, the combined use of Topology Optimization (TO) algorithms and AM production processes has permitted to manufacture components with optimized stiffness mass distribution. When components are designed with TO algorithms, constraints on the maximum allowable stress within the component, e.g. the yield stress or the fatigue limit if quasi-static or cyclic loads are applied, respectively, are set to guarantee their structural integrity under several loading conditions. However, even with optimized process parameters, detrimental manufacturing defects, like pores, cluster of pores and lack of fusion defects, can form within the component affecting the fatigue response and lowering the fatigue limit. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the influence of defects when AM components are designed. To this aim, the Authors recently developed a property TO code, named TopFat, that provides the optimized topology by also considering the influence of defects on the fatigue response. In the present paper, the developed TopFat methodology is implemented by using a commercial software. The optimized topologies for literature traditional benchmarks obtained with the property code are compared with those obtained with the TopFat methodology implemented by using a commercial software. The differences between the two topologies are highlighted and discussed, with the aim of showing that the TopFat methodology can be reliably used for the design against fatigue failures from defects even with TO algorithms available in commercial software. © 2021 The Authors.

Even when producers provide detailed information on the food supply chain, consumers feel overwhelmed by the amount of information to process. A questionnaire delivered to 1,000+ respondents in Italy revealed that customers look for quick information on their sustainability while grocery shopping. However, 23% of respondents don’t have time to read labels. As a result, we propose a platform capable of facilitating customers’ choices for high quality food. This includes a decision-making algorithm which takes into consideration all of the information provided by producers, delivering an immediate rating of the food based on its environmental and social impact. © The author/s, 2021},

abstract={In recent years, Additive Manufacturing (AM) emerged as a disruptive technology, able to manufacture complex geometries and features, which are not producible through traditional manufacturing processes. The diffusion of AM has therefore permitted to exploit the advantages of the design based on Topology Optimization (TO) algorithms, which provide the material distribution allowing for maximizing the component stiffness with the minimum mass. In order to guarantee the structural integrity of the designed part, constraints on the maximum allowable stress can be set. If the component is subjected to quasi-static loads, the yield stress is generally considered as the limit stress. In case of fatigue loads, the conventional fatigue limit can be, on the other hand, considered. However, it is well known that the fatigue response of parts produced through AM process is controlled by the manufacturing defects (e.g., porosity, incomplete fusion defects). The influence of defects is generally not considered when components are designed through TO algorithms, even if it drives the structural response. Only recently, a defect-driven TO algorithm, named TopFat, has been developed by the Authors. In the present paper, a methodology based on TO algorithms commercially available for the design against fatigue failures from defects is proposed. The influence of defects and the dependency between the defect size and the component volume is assessed through models available in the literature. The methodology has been applied to design components currently used for aerospace applications. To conclude, this study aims at providing a guideline for safely designing real AM parts considering the presence of defects by means of commercial TO software. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

abstract={The effectiveness of composite materials in crashworthiness applications is well-known in the literature. In most cases, the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of composite structures is higher than that of metallic structures, but at present there is no standard available to characterize their crash behavior. A new fixture to test flat composite samples in in-plane impact conditions has been used to investigate the effect of the impact speed and of the friction on the SEA of carbon fiber/epoxy flat plates. Tests have been carried out in impact conditions. The effect of the friction has been studied varying the clamping force given by the fixture. The force-displacement curves have been acquired in all tests and used to calculate the SEA of the material. The tested specimens have shown a splaying failure mode and values of SEA that increase with the clamping force given by the testing fixture. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this work, an innovative experimental methodology is presented for the assessment of damage severity in composites. The technique aims at determining the local variation of the elastic properties in the damaged region of a composite component. Based on the Impulse Excitation Technique (IET), the vibrational response of the inspected region is isolated by clamping its extremities through vacuum, thus allowing the assessment of local variations. Complementarily, a new analytical approach is derived for the assessment of the residual elastic properties of the damaged area from the measurement of the first resonant frequency. Validation of the proposed methodology is performed on two glass-fibre woven fabric composites, damaged by impact. The material properties of the damaged zone determined through the proposed technique are compared to the results of tensile tests performed on specimens cut from the impacted plates. In particular, the specimens are equipped with optic fibre in order to punctually measure the elastic parameters. Results show that the residual elastic properties assessed with the proposed technique are in very good agreement with those measured through the optic fibre, thus proving the effectiveness of the methodology. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={In the last years, with the development of Additive Manufacturing processes, the research on the mechanical behaviour of lattice structures has gained significant attention. Depending on the application, the mechanical properties of the unit cell can be modified by varying its geometry. The cell geometry is generally designed through Finite Element Analyses. However, the simulation of the mechanical response of components made of lattice structures can be rather complex, due to the long computation time. Therefore, efficient simplified models should be employed, but, in this case, an experimental validation is required. In the paper, experimental compression tests are carried out on cubic specimens in lattice structures produced with a carbon nylon filament through a Fused Deposition Modeling process and with an AlSi10Mg alloy through a Selective Laser Melting process. The tests on carbon nylon specimens are carried out to assess the cell geometry ensuring the highest energy absorption among five selected cell geometries. Subsequently, a Finite Element (FE) model of the lattice structure specimens is created by using 1D beam elements and experimentally validated with the results obtained by testing manufactured specimens. The activity in the paper proves the effectiveness of models with 1D elements for the simulation of the mechanical response of the lattice structures and the importance of validating FE models to assess their real failure mode. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Topology Optimisation (TO) is one of the most popular design tools for additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Indeed, AM allows creating the complex geometries provided by TO algorithms. However, AM processes such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or Electron Beam Melting (EBM) suffer from local slight fluctuations of the process parameters during the building phase, leading to the formation of defects, like pores, clusters of pores, lack of fusion defects, that drive the fatigue response of the material. For this reason, the TO algorithm must consider the presence of the defect population to reliably design the optimised component in the fatigue regime. Recently, the Authors developed a defect-driven TO algorithm with proprietary code, named TopFat, that exploits the Murakami fatigue model to safely design the AM optimised components. In the present paper, the TopFat methodology is extended to the HyperWorks commercial software to unlock a wide-ranging set of industrial and academic applications. This extension allows including the defect population within the TO algorithm without the need for a specific complex code. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Despite the growing diffusion of composite materials in automotive and aerospace sectors, a standard procedure for testing their crashworthiness has not been developed yet. At present, the international standards for testing composite materials under impact conditions are not adequate to test their crush behavior. In this paper, a procedure for measuring the energy absorption due to the compressive crushing of a composite flat specimen along its mid plane is proposed. The experimental setup requires a fixture to hold the specimen and to avoid its buckling and an instrumented drop weight tower to obtain the force-displacement curves with the aim of calculating the Specific Energy Absorption. The paper describes the adopted test procedure and some of the features of the newly developed experimental setup. The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated by testing several glass fiber-epoxy specimens under different impact energies. © 2021, Gruppo Italiano Frattura. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A new approach for the nondestructive determination of the elastic properties of composite laminates is presented. The approach represents an improvement of a recently published experimental methodology based on the Impulse Excitation Technique, which allows nondestructively assessing local elastic properties of composite laminates by isolating a region of interest through a proper clamping system. Different measures of the first resonant frequency are obtained by rotating the clamping system with respect to the material orientation. Here, in order to increase the robustness of the inverse problem, which determines the elastic properties from the measured resonant frequencies, information related to the modal shape is retained by considering the effect of an additional concentrated mass on the first resonant frequency. According to the modal shape and the position of the mass, different values of the first resonant frequency are obtained. Here, two positions of the additional mass, i.e., two values of the resonant frequency in addition to the unloaded frequency value, are considered for each material orientation. A Rayleigh–Ritz formulation based on higher order theory is adopted to compute the first resonant frequency of the clamped plate with concentrated mass. The elastic properties are finally determined through an optimization problem that minimizes the discrepancy on the frequency reference values. The proposed approach is validated on several materials taken from the literature. Finally, advantages and possible limitations are discussed. © 2020 by the author.

Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) of two different sizes, 5 and 30 μm, were used to modify a composite material made with 64 wt.% of unidirectional fibres and a low-viscosity epoxy resin. The effect of the nanomodification with 30 μm GNPs was also studied on composite plates prepared with a higher viscosity resin. Three laminate thicknesses (4, 8, and 16 layers) were tested with a standard drop dart testing technique. The peak forces as well as the absorbed energy and the fracture surfaces, observed with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), were compared. Experimental results showed that nano-modification with 5 μm particles had a detrimental effect on both the peak forces and the absorbed energy, whereas the addition of 30 μm GNPs increased the absorbed energy, especially for a laminate thickness of 16 layers. Overall, the experimental results demonstrated that the size of graphene nanoparticles has a significant effect on the impact response of composite laminates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Despite superior specific mechanical characteristics of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs), a lack of understanding of their fracture mechanisms under different impact conditions has limited the application of CFRP energy-absorbing structures. To avoid complex and expensive tests on the final structure, it is more convenient to test flat elements. To prevent catastrophic crushing due to the global buckling, flat specimens must be supported by a specific fixture. Previously developed fixtures had shortcomings like tearing of the specimen, jamming of the fixture, short crushable length, or they were specifically designed only for one failure mode. This newly designed fixture overcomes the limitations of previously published solutions. The final configuration includes cylindrical anti-buckling columns 10 mm in diameter and spaced 65 mm apart with adjustable heights. The fixture is designed for rectangular specimens with dimensions of 150 × 100 mm and different thicknesses up to 16 mm, like the ones mandated by the ASTM D7137 standard test method for compression after impact analysis. Other features of this new fixture are the possibility to study the effects of different defects on the crashworthiness of composites, higher crushing area, and integration with Instron drop tower and hydraulic testing machines. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Fibre reinforced plastics have tailorable and superior mechanical characteristics compared to metals and can be used to construct relevant components such as primary crash structures for automobiles. However, the absence of standardized methodologies to predict component level damage has led to their underutilization as compared to their metallic counterparts, which are used extensively to manufacture primary crash structures. This paper presents a methodology that uses crashworthiness results from in-plane impact tests, conducted on carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy flat plates, to tune the related material card in Radioss using two different parametric identification techniques: global and adaptive response search methods. The resulting virtual material model was then successfully validated by comparing the crushing behavior with results obtained from experiments that were conducted by impacting a Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) crash box. Use of automated identification techniques significantly reduces the development time of composite crash structures, whilst the predictive capability reduces the need for component level tests, thereby making the development process more efficient, automated and economical, thereby reducing the cost of development using composite materials. This in turn promotes the development of vehicles that meet safety standards with lower mass and noxious gas emissions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The paper proposes a new model for the assessment of size effects affecting the fracture strength of brittle materials. The proposed model permits to accurately estimate the relation between the specimen strength, the initial defect size and to take into account the strength variation with respect to the tested volume. The proposed methodology is analytically defined and thereafter validated with the literature data obtained through tests on different types of brittle materials, and on specimens with increasing volume. A simple procedure for parameter estimation is also defined in the paper. The literature validation proves the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, with the resulting fitting models in well agreement with the experimental dataset and characterized by high values of coefficients of correlation, similar or larger than those obtained in the literature with different approaches. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={The electrification of road vehicle powertrains has recently gained growing interest worldwide as an effective solution to comply tightening regulations on CO2 emissions. In hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), multiple power components, such as internal combustion engine, electric motor/generators, and battery system, are included in the powertrain to improve vehicle performances, thus involving an increase of the powertrain envelope and of the overall vehicle mass. Larger vehicle mass affects the design of the structural framework, which expands its envelope to meet safety requirements. The expansions of both powertrain systems and structural framework are indeed constrained by the limited vehicle widthtrack, which demands for tradeoff studies at early vehicle design phases to achieve a feasible solution while optimizing performances related to different design disciplines. These particularly include proper sizing of power components to achieve optimal fuel economy capabilities and accurate design of structural components to satisfy crashworthiness criteria while minimizing the associated structural mass. In this framework, the achievement of a globally optimal solution requires a cooperative development process that addresses the design problem accounting for all these disciplinary contributions in an integrated manner. This paper proposes a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) framework for the preliminary design of a power-split HEV powertrain accounting for crashworthiness requirements. A multidisciplinary feasible optimization architecture is particularly illustrated that includes a sequential scheme to evaluate the disciplines and a direct search method as the global system optimizer. Different sizes are swept for the internal combustion engine, the electric motors, and the planetary gear ratios. A multi-fidelity approach is considered for the crashworthiness analysis, to assess the feasibility of powertrain configurations. Results show that, including crashworthiness analysis in the MDO formulation of the design problem, the identified optimal design differs from the outcome of a powertrain-only based optimization process. Particularly, benefits in terms of global solution feasibility and associated computational cost are achieved. The presented methodology allows to efficiently integrate powertrain analyses and crashworthiness constraints and it is suited for the early design of HEVs. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The present paper evaluated the accuracy of two different methods for transferring working length (WL) between manual endodontic instruments and nickel-titanium (NiTi) shaping files. Thirty root canals of extracted permanent teeth were used. Root canals were divided according to canal length (CL) and canal curvature (CC). The reference cusp and the root end were flattened to provide reproducible and accurate measurements. During shaping, the WL measurements were obtained with manual k-files (KF) and transferred to WaveOne (W1) NiTi reciprocating files using the traditional method with the endodontic ruler (method I) and an alternative clinical procedure based on the comparison of the instruments side by side from tip to shank (method II). For each file and each tested method, two measures were taken by two examiners using Rhino (ver. 4.0, McNeel, Seattle, WA, USA) software for a total of 360 (30 × 3 × 2 × 2) measures. Analysis of variance was performed by taking the difference in length (Delta WL, DWL) between files used for the same canal. The difference between methods I and II for WL transfer was found to be statistically significant (df = 1; F = 71.52; p < 0.001). The DWL absolute values obtained with method II were found to be closer to 0 mm (i.e., same length as corresponding KF) than those obtained with method I. Both CL (df = 2; F = 1.27; p = 0.300) and CC (df = 1; F = 2.22; p = 0.149) did not significantly influence WL measurements. With respect to WL transfer, method II seemed to better preserve the correct WL transfer between instruments during the clinical endodontic procedures. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Additive manufacturing for fibre-reinforced composite structures is rapidly diffusing, since it enables the production of lightweight structural parts characterized by complex geometries and tailored fibre orientations. Therefore, the development of design methodologies capable to simultaneously optimize the shape of the fibre-reinforced composite part and the fibre orientation in the additive manufacturing process is, at present, of utmost interest among industries and research centres. In this paper, a novel simultaneous optimisation method capable to optimise the topology and the local fibre orientation is proposed. The method is computationally cheap, fast convergent and permits to avoid stress peaks, working efficiently on 2D and on 3D models. The analytical formulation of the problem and the optimisation algorithm are at first described. The optimisation criteria are based on the uniform strain energy density distribution and the fibre alignement along the principal stress direction. The proposed method is then verified with several benchmarks from the literature and with a 3D illustrative example, confirming that it can be effectively and efficiently employed for the optimisation of composite components to be produced through additive manufacturing. © IMechE 2020.},

abstract={In this work, a polyolefin thermoplastic adhesive has been modified with three different weight percentages, 3%, 5% and 10% of iron oxide powder. The use of this nano-modified adhesive coupled with this technology, offers an improved resistance to applied loads, new opportunities connected with the bonding process and the possibilities to dismantle plastic components for reusing, repairing or recycling at the end of life. In this research activity, the mechanical properties of the pristine and modified adhesive have been assessed. Furthermore, the effect of three different accelerated ageing cycles, currently used by automotive industries, have been studied in relation to the mechanical behaviour and separation time. Three ageing cycles were evaluated that are: hot, humid and mixed cycles. Single Lap Joint tests prove the variations of the mechanical properties and adhesion strength during the accelerated ageing, especially for the hot cycle. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy has been used and shows that the adhesives exposed to the hottest ageing cycle presented a high value of the oxidation that leads to a partial detachment of the adhesive from the plastic substrates. Joint separations by means of an induction heating system showed that adhesive joints can be separated before and after ageing cycles. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={It is well-known in the literature that the fatigue response of specimens produced through Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes is mainly controlled by the defect population. Nevertheless, microstructure, residual stresses and building orientation must be considered as they may also play a significant role. In the present paper, the influence of microstructure, residual stresses and building orientation on the Very-High-Cycle-Fatigue (VHCF) response of SLM AlSi10Mg specimens has been experimentally assessed. Ultrasonic tests on AlSI10Mg specimens with different building orientations and subjected to different heat treatments showed that, together with the defect size, microstructure and residual stresses significantly affect the VHCF response. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this work, a thermoplastic adhesive used by automotive industries for bonding plastic components has been modified with iron oxide nanoparticles to ease the dismounting process. Two different processes have been considered for the joint dismounting, namely the already studied electromagnetic induction and an innovative microwave heating process. Besides the mentioned heating activation process, a full experimental plan has been designed that includes two different weight percentages (5% and 10%) of the nanoparticles and two alternative mixing methods: hand-mixing and extrusion methods. The mechanical performances and the separation tests have been assessed by using single lap joints. The adhesive joints prepared with the nanomodified adhesives and with the hand-mixing method presents a slightly larger value of the maximum strength due to the presence of small agglomerates that have been observed with scanning electron microscope analysis. On the other hand, the extrusion method gave a very uniform distribution of the particles within the adhesive matrix. Microwave and induction heating tests conducted on both the single lap joint and the adhesive itself showed that the joint separation and the melting of the adhesive are possible by using both adhesives prepared with the two mixing methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Torsional shear strength and elastic properties of an adhesively bonded glass-to-steel component were measured on several joined steel-to-steel and steel-to-glass samples. An epoxy resin-based adhesive was used as joining material for AISI304 steel and soda-lime glass. The same steel and adhesive were used to obtain steel-to-steel joined sample bars to be tested in asymmetrical four-point bending, for comparison purposes. The indentation elastic modulus of the adhesive, both inside the joined region and as a bulk, was measured by nano-indentation and impulse excitation technique. Finally, the effect of etching on the glass was studied and correlated to the glass-steel joint strength. This study shows that torsion test can be used to provide reliable shear strength values for design and modelling glass-to-steel adhesive joined components. © 2020},

abstract={In the present paper, the very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) response of a structural adhesive used for automotive applications, Betaforce 4600G modified with microspheres, has been experimentally assessed. Ultrasonic fully reversed tension–compression tests up to 109 cycles have been carried out with the testing machine developed by the authors on adhesives without macroscopic defects and on adhesives with artificial defects, inserted during the butt-joint preparation. Fracture surfaces have been observed with the optical microscope and the P-S-N curves estimated. Experimental results have shown that defect location significantly affects the VHCF strength and fracture surfaces exhibit a peculiar morphology with three distinct characteristic regions. © 2020 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The effect of building orientation on the very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) response of Ti-6Al-4V specimens produced through selective laser melting (SLM) process with three different building orientations (0°, 45° and 90°) has been experimentally assessed. The fatigue performance decreases with different building orientations from 0° to 90°. The fatigue crack origin has been found to be always an internal defect both at high-cycle fatigue and VHCF regime independent of building orientations. Size of defects induced fatigue failures and the stress intensity factor range decrease with the number of cycles to failure. By considering the VHCF strength at 109 cycles, the median value decreases from 217 MPa (0°) to 201 MPa (45°) and finally to 155 MPa (90°), with a 40% reduction from 0° to 90°. The building orientation significantly influences both the defect size and the resulting VHCF response. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the contact pressure distribution of two different nickel-titanium (NiTi) endodontic rotary instruments against the root canal walls and to virtually predict their centering ability during shaping with finite element analysis (FEA). Resin blocks simulating root canals were used. One was shaped with ProGlider and ProTaper Next (PTN) X1-X2 and one with ScoutRace and BioRace (BR) 1, 2 and 3. Both resin blocks were virtually replicated with computer-aided design (CAD) software. The endodontic instruments ProTaper Next (PTN) X2 and BioRace BR3 were also replicated with CAD. The NiTi instruments and the shaped blocks geometries were discretized and exported for FEA. The instrument rotation in the root canals was simulated. The finite element simulation was performed by applying an insertion and extraction force of 2.5 N with a constant rotational speed (300 rpm). To highlight possible differences between pressure distributions against the root canal portions outside and inside the canal curvature, the parameter Var was originally defined. Var values were systematically lower for PTN X2, revealing a better centering ability. FEA proved effective for the virtual prediction of the centering ability of NiTi instruments during an early design phase without the use of prototypes. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The research on the size-effects in Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) has recently drawn the attention of several scholars. The fatigue cracks in VHCF originate from the largest defect present within the loaded material volume (risk-volume) and the larger the risk-volume, the larger the probability of critical defects affecting the VHCF response (size-effect). Many models have been proposed in the literature to deal with size-effects in VHCF. However, the proposed models cannot be validated on full-scale components, since VHCF tests are typically carried out with ultrasonic fatigue testing machines. The authors have proposed a specimen geometry, the so-called Gaussian specimens, to enlarge as much as possible the risk-volume in ultrasonic VHCF tests. In this study, fully reversed tension-compression ultrasonic VHCF tests up to 109 cycles were carried out on AISI H13 steel Gaussian specimens with a risk-volume of 5000 mm3, two times larger than the largest tested in the literature. The stress distribution and the absence of bending loads were verified with strain gages, proving that VHCF tests on risk-volumes of 5000 mm3 can be reliably carried out. Ultrasonic VHCF tests were also carried out on small hourglass specimens, confirming that larger risk-volumes allow for a more reliable design against VHCF failures. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={An experimental investigation on adhesively bonded joints has been carried out by using an adhesive used in automotive applications. The main goal of this work is to characterize the mechanical behaviour of the adhesive joints subjected to different loading angles and understand whether the cataphoresis painting process can be used to cure the adhesive. To this aim, two different typical temperatures, used for the cataphoresis process, have been used for curing the studied adhesive. Arcan test has been used to characterize the mechanical behaviour of the adhesive joints by using five different loading angles: 0° (shear condition), 30°, 45°, 60° (combined shear-tensile), and 90° (tensile). The experimental tests showed that the adopted curing cycles conducted at 190 °C for 15′ and 160 °C for 45′ are both able to fully cure the adhesive, this was verified with Differential Scanning Calorimeter analysis (DSC). The two curing temperatures do not lead to significant differences in the maximum values of the strength. Arcan test conducted at different loading angles shows that the maximum value of the strength is obtained for the condition of shear loading (about 10 MPa nominal strength), while the lowest value is related to the condition of tensile loading (about 5 MPa nominal strength). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis was used to assess the distribution of the hollow glass spheres that are embedded in this adhesive to set the thickness layer. © 2020},

abstract={In the paper, the influence of the annealing temperature on the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) of AlSi10Mg specimens produced through selective laser melting (SLM) is experimentally assessed. VHCF tests at 20 kHz are carried out on Gaussian specimens subjected to a heat treatment suggested by the system supplier (heating for 2 hours to 320°C and air cooling) and to a heat treatment proposed by the authors (heating for 2 hours to 244°C and air cooling). The defects originating failure and the conditional P-S-N curves are compared. Experimental results show that an annealing temperature of 320 ° C induces the spheroidization of the Si network, which enhances the ductility but has a negative effect on the VHCF response. On the contrary, by reducing the heating temperature to 244 ° C, the original as-built microstructure is not altered and the minimization of the residual stresses permits to enhance the VHCF response. © 2019 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The present paper investigates the effect of a stress relief heat treatment (two hours at 320 °C and air cooling down) on the VHCF response of an AlSi10Mg alloy produced through SLM. Ultrasonic tension-compression tests up to 10 9 cycles were carried out on as-built and heat treated Gaussian specimens with a large loaded volume. Experimental results showed that the investigated heat treatment has a detrimental effect on the VHCF response: VHCF strength reduction is larger than 20% at number of cycles above 10 8 . The microstructural changes induced by the heat treatment (i.e., rupture and spheroidization of the original eutectic silicon network) was shown to be the main reason for the VHCF decrement, thus suggesting that an optimization of the heat treatment parameters is required. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In structural component applications the use of composite materials is increasing thanks to their optimal mechanical characteristics. However, the complexity of the damage evolution in composite materials significantly limits their widespread diffusion. Non-destructive tests are thus becoming ever more important. The detecting Damage Index (DId) technique has been recently brought in the realm of the non-destructive characterization tests for components made of composite material. In contrast to other techniques, this methodology allows to quantitatively assess local residual properties. In this paper, the DId technique is adopted in combination with the finite element method. The mechanical response of two composite plates (an 8-layer twill fabric carbon/epoxy) subjected to four-point bending test is firstly used to tune a finite element model of the laminate. Then, an undamaged laminate of the same composite material is progressively damaged through repeated four-point bending tests. Local residual elastic properties are mapped on the plate through the DId technique. A continuous polynomial curve has been considered to account for the variation of the elastic modulus in the finite element model. The resulting force-displacement curve of the numerical analysis is compared to experimental data of damaged plate, resulting in very good agreement. The combination of the experimental activity and the numerical finite element analysis points out the accuracy of the DId methodology in assessing local residual elastic properties of composite materials. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In this work, a hot-melt adhesive used by automotive industries for bonding plastic components has been modified with three different percentages of nanofiller (iron oxide) in order to make the adhesive electromagnetically sensitive and to perform adhesive joint separations. Fe 3 O 4 particles with a weight concentration of 3%, 5% and 10% were embedded in the adhesive matrix. Single Lap Joint (SLJ) tests showed that a slight increase of the maximum load and a more ductile behaviour are obtained. The sensitivity of these modified adhesive performance to the induction heating process was studied with respect to some relevant parameters: the current (or power), the frequency of the electromagnetic induction field and the shape of the coil. Furthermore, the diameter of the hollow copper coil was modified in order to understand whether the coil temperature has an effect on the separation time. The separation time, that is an index of the time needed to reach the melt of the adhesive and the consequent SLJ separation, together with the temperature profile of the adhesives have been used to evaluate the sensitivity of these adhesives to the process parameters. The analysis on the temperature and separation time showed that the most influencing parameter is the frequency of the electromagnetic induction field. As expected, also the shape of the coil influences the separation time, in particular, the adhesive joint separated with the pancake coil showed lower values of the separation time compared to the solenoidal coils. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) showed that iron oxide particles tend to form small agglomerate that resulted well dispersed in the adhesive matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to verify that the separation procedure do not degrades these modified adhesives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the last decades, the fatigue lifetime of structural components has increased significantly and in many industrial applications (aerospace, automotive, and energy production industry) is even larger than 1010 cycles. Therefore, the interest in the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) behavior of materials has grown rapidly, becoming a subject of primary interest among university and industries. In high-strength steels, VHCF failures generally originate from defects/inclusions; consequently, the steel cleanliness significantly affects the VHCF response. Furthermore, since the probability of finding critical defects in a loaded volume increases with the loaded volume, the loaded volume also significantly affects the VHCF response. This is generally referred to as the “size-effect” in VHCF. The present paper investigates the effects of the manufacturing process and the size-effect on the VHCF response of an AISI H13 steel. Experimental tests were performed on hourglass and Gaussian specimens made of two different types of AISI H13 steels: Unrefined H13 and refined Electroslag Remelting (ESR) H13. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), which was carried out on the test results, and the P–S–N curves showed that the two factors (i.e., the manufacturing process and the size-effect) significantly affect the VHCF response. © 2019 by the author.

abstract={In the last decades, the use of structural and no structural adhesive has been increasing a lot in the automotive sector due to the advantages they can offer compared to traditional fasteners. Although they present many advantages, the impossibility to dismantle easily adhesive joints in order to substitute, recycle, reuse vehicle components or avoid waste for bonding errors is a factor that can limit their use. Furthermore, in Europe, the need to separate vehicle components for reuse and recycling is constrained by two Directives, 2000/53/EC and 2000/64/EC. These Directives set the objectives of reuse and recyclability for automotive vehicles, which are 95% and 85% respectively by an average weight per vehicle. For these reasons, it is very important to find a feasible solution to these problems. A promising technology for the separation of plastic joints, bonded with thermoplastic adhesives, uses nanomodified thermoplastic adhesives that are sensitive to electromagnetic fields. In this work, the mechanical behavior of adhesive joints made with a polyolefin adhesive, used in the automotive industry for bonding plastic components, have been studied. In particular, the adhesive has been modified with three different weight concentrations (3%, 5% and 10%) of iron oxide nanoparticles in order to make it sensitive to electromagnetic fields. These nanoparticles heat when are under the effect of an electromagnetic field and consequently they can melt the thermoplastic adhesive allowing for the joint separation. The mechanical properties of the joints prepared with the pristine and nanomodified particles have been studied by means of SLJ specimen with different overlap length and thicknesses. The adhesive joints prepared with the modified adhesives present a slightly higher load and a larger ductility compared to the ones prepared with the pristine one. Furthermore, separation tests have been performed in order to assess the times to disassemble these adhesive joints. Scanning electron microscope analysis has been used to assess the dispersion of the particles. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Among the materials used for the production of components through Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes, the Selective-Laser-Melting (SLM) Ti6Al4V alloy is widely employed in aerospace applications for its high specific strength and in biomedical applications for its good biocompatibility. Actual structural applications are generally limited to static loading conditions where the large defects originating during the SLM process do not play a significant role for the static failure. On the contrary, the same defects strongly affect the fatigue response of the parts since they act as crack initiation sites that rapidly lead to fatigue failure. In the literature, a lot of research has been carried out to investigate the quasi-static and the High-Cycle Fatigue properties of the SLM Ti6Al4V alloy but there are still few studies on its Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response. In the paper, the VHCF response of Ti6Al4V specimens, which are vertically orientated during the SLM building and then subjected to a conventional heat treatment (2 hours heating in vacuum at 850°C), is experimentally assessed. Ultrasonic VHCF tests are carried out on Gaussian specimens with a large risk-volume (2300 mm3). Fracture surfaces are investigated for revealing the defect originating the fatigue failure. The Stress Intensity Factor Threshold associated to the experimental failures is finally estimated. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={It is well-known that many manufacturing parameters affect the quasi-static and the fatigue response of additive manufacturing (AM) parts. In particular, due to the layer-by-layer production, the load orientation, with respect to the building direction, plays a fundamental role for the fatigue response. This paper investigates the fatigue response up to 109 cycles (very high cycle fatigue (VHCF)) of selective laser melting (SLM) AlSi10Mg specimens built in a vertical direction. Ultrasonic tension-compression tests (stress ratio of -1) are carried out on as-built Gaussian specimens with a large loaded volume (2300 mm3). Fracture surfaces are investigated with the scanning electron microscope to analyze the defects originating the VHCF failure. Probabilistic S-N curves are estimated and analyzed. Experimental results confirm that the defect size controls the VHCF response, thus highlighting the importance of testing large risk volumes for a reliable assessment of VHCF behavior. The average value of the VHCF strength is close to that of the hourglass specimen tested in the literature. The variability of the VHCF strength is instead significantly larger, due to the scattered size distribution of the defects located near the specimen surface, which is the most critical region for crack initiation. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In the last few years, the use of adhesive joints for structural applications has rapidly increased and adhesives are more often subject to fatigue loads during their in-service life. In presence of a rapidly varying load, such as a high-frequency vibration, adhesively bonded joints may undergo fatigue lives in the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) region that are significantly larger than those investigated in usual high-cycle fatigue tests. The present paper proposes an innovative testing technique for performing accelerated fully reversed tension-compression VHCF tests on adhesive butt-joints. The procedure for the design of the adherends is described and then experimentally validated. Ultrasonic VHCF tests are finally carried out on a cyanoacrylate butt-joint up to 109 cycles: experimental results show that the proposed testing equipment permits an effective assessment of the VHCF response of the adhesive in a limited testing time. © 2018 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The impact response of a reversible adhesive joint is experimentally assessed in this work. Joint reversibility is improved with a system that uses nanomodification of the thermoplastic adhesive used for bonding plastic components. This system, coupled with electromagnetic induction, is able to guarantee the separation of joints without any damage to the substrates. Drop dart tests at different impact velocities are carried out on neat and nanomodified bonded joints in order to compare the impact behavior before and after the introduction of nanoparticles. Experimental results show that the impact response, assessed in terms of peak load, absorbed energy, and flexural stiffness, can be affected by the introduction of nanoparticles. This work shows that adhesive nanomodified joints represent an effective and applicable solution for the reversible assembling of semi-structural components subjected to low-velocity impact loads. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={It is well known in the literature that fatigue is particularly critical for Additive Manufacturing (AM) parts, because internal defects originating during the AM process represent a critical site for crack initiation. In the literature, the High-Cycle-Fatigue (HCF) response of AM parts has been extensively investigated; however, there are few results on the Very-High-Cycle-Fatigue (VHCF) behavior of AM parts, even if the number of machinery components that may sustain VHCF is rapidly increasing in the last years. The present paper investigates the VHCF response of an AlSi10Mg alloy produced through Selective Laser Melting. Ultrasonic tests are carried out on Gaussian specimens with a large loaded volume and show that fatigue failures in VHCF originate from surface and sub-surface defects with the same mechanism of HCF failures. P-S-N curves and fatigue strength at 109 cycles are finally estimated to show the effect of defect size on the VHCF strength. Research highlights: Ultrasonic VHCF tests on AlSi10Mg Gaussian specimens produced through SLM. Identification and analysis of critical AM defects inducing VHCF failure. Statistical estimation of models for the prediction of the VHCF response of AM parts. Statistical prediction of effect of defect size on the VHCF response of AM parts. © 2018 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Advances in computational technology have resulted in the dramatic reduction of computational time for crashworthiness analysis, hence enabling its structural design optimization. Surrogate modeling has been shown to further reduce computational effort as well as to smooth noisy responses. Crashworthiness optimization problems are, though, ill posed as they include nonlinear, noncontinuous and noisy responses. This violates the Hadamard conditions for well-posed problems and therefore the applicability of gradient-based algorithms is limited. Here, discontinuities in the responses with respect to the design variables will be handled that result in large changes in the system functions with only small changes in the design variables using a novel surrogate modeling technique. The applicability of typical global surrogate models is limited when critical discontinuities are present. An efficient method has been developed here to identify the number of discontinuities and their position in the design domain. Previous works assume a said number of discontinuities; here though, the number of discontinuities is not given a priori. The discontinuities are identified by examining the relative difference in the response value of samples in immediate proximity of each other. Samples in the same continuous subdomain are clustered and a support vector machine for classification is exploited to locate discontinuities. Local approximations are then used for the continuous subspaces between the discontinuities. Lastly, a surrogate-based design optimization is carried out. Starting with a two-bar truss, demonstrating a snap-through discontinuity, this method is shown to account for such discontinuities. This is then integrated into an optimization framework. Further academic example, namely a six-bar truss is modeled using the open-source framework Kratos Multiphysics and then optimized, showing the applicability of the method to problems with multiple discontinuities. Finally, a crash-absorbing tube is optimized that is impacted with an angle resulting in a noncontinuous design space: desired axial crushing and undesirable global buckling. After summarizing the results, advantages and possible limitations are discussed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={To evaluate the influence of layer and laminate thickness on the repeated impact response of E-glass/epoxy laminates, two types of cross-ply stacking sequences ([0/90]3n and [03/903]n), with two different thicknesses (4 mm and 8 mm), were analyzed. The investigation, led by running quasi-static perforation tests and repeated impact tests, outlined the better performance of [03/903]n laminates. Experimental results were analyzed through a macroscopic damage variable (damage index DI) and by microscopic observation and digitalized profiles of impacted specimens. The higher damage tolerance of [03/903]n laminates was found to depend on the capability of spreading the damage over a more extended area and of tolerating a higher permanent deflection. For both laminate types, the end of the steady damage accumulation phase was observed to correspond to through-thickness transverse cracking. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.},

abstract={A hot melt adhesive – mainly used for bonding plastic component in automotive field – was modified with different iron-based particles to give it a reversible behaviour. Mechanical and physical properties of these reversible adhesives were experimentally assessed in the work. The modified adhesives, coupled with electromagnetic induction, are able to guarantee separation of the joints without any damage to the substrates for recycling, reuse or repairing of components. Single lap joint specimens were prepared using epoxy/glass fibres substrates and tests were carried out on neat and modified adhesive with 5% weight of iron and iron oxide. Three different Fe particles size were tested: 450 µm, 60 µm and 1–6 µm. The particles size of iron oxide was 50 nm. Separation was studied using single lap joint specimens under electro-magnetic induction. Experimental results showed that the maximum peak load decreases when the average particles sizes increase. The peak loads of the smallest particles were equal to the ones of the pristine adhesive. The elongation of the adhesives increases when the adhesive is modified with both iron and iron oxide particles. Finally, experimental tests on single lap joints coupled with electro-magnetic induction showed that separation of the substrates is possible using iron oxide particles. Electro-magnetic tests conducted on particles alone, helped to understand that bigger particles are able to overcome the melting temperature of the adhesive but hot-melt adhesives modified with these particles are not able to reach the melting. These tests showed that the number of particles into the adhesive matrix is very important for this kind of tests. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.},

abstract={Extensive experimental investigations show that internal defects play a key role in the very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) response of metallic materials and that crack growth from internal defects can take place even if the stress intensity factor associated to the initial defect is below the threshold for crack growth. By introducing a reduction term in the typical formulation of the threshold for crack growth, the authors recently proposed a general phenomenological model, which can effectively describe crack growth from internal defects in VHCF. The model is able to consider the different crack growth scenarios that may arise in VHCF and is enough general to embrace the various weakening mechanisms proposed in the literature for explaining why crack can grow below the threshold. In the present paper, the model is generalized in a statistical framework. The statistical distributions of the crack growth threshold and of the initial defect size are put into the model. The procedure for the estimation of the Probabilistic-S-N curves and of the fatigue limit distribution is illustrated and numerically applied to an experimental dataset. © 2017 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In this work, a T-joint structure made of woven fabric carbon/epoxy composite has been numerically investigated, using the commercial software LS-DYNA, by referring to previous experimental tests performed by the authors. The analyzed component can be considered as a simplified version of the real T-joint which connects the B-pillar and the longitudinal rocker in car body structure. Its mechanical behavior under transverse bending has been firstly evaluated through a series of experimental tests and then simulated with transient nonlinear finite element analysis with explicit time integration. The goal is to properly account nonlinear effects and improve the accuracy of the finite element prediction. In particular, the attention has been posed on the nonlinearities due to the manufacturing process and design of the experimental setup. Parameters related to the material properties and to the compliance of constraints are carefully considered to understand their influence on the load-carrying capacity and the failure mode of the structure. By properly setting those parameters in LS-DYNA environment, a very good agreement between experimental and numerical simulation results is obtained. © 2018 33rd Technical Conference of the American Society for Composites 2018.

abstract={In this work, the mechanical properties of two different adhesives compositions have been investigated both experimentally and numerically. The studied thermoplastic adhesives are Hot-Melt Adhesive (HMA). In particular, a pristine and a nanomodified adhesive with 10% in weight of iron oxide have been considered. The adhesives have been subjected to a series of single lap joint (SLJ) tests using adherends made of polypropylene copolymer. As it is well-known, the structural-mechanical behavior of adhesive joints is mostly influenced by the bonding process: thickness of adhesive as well as its application procedures and the surface preparation of adherends are among the most influencing factors. In addition, the mechanical behavior of SLJ test is particularly influenced by the correct alignment of adherends and applied load. These aspects have been investigated, analyzing the experimental results. Moreover, the experimental results have been used to develop a numerical model of the two adhesives. The numerical analysis has been carried out using the commercial software LS-DYNA. Transient nonlinear finite element analysis has been performed to simulate the mechanical behavior of the thermoplastic adhesives. In particular, the cohesive formulations of the elements have been taken into consideration after a careful literature review. In order to set-up and to validate the mechanical properties of the adhesives, the experimental SLJ tests have been simulated. The developed finite element models enable to investigate more complex joint structures where these types of adhesives are used, such as plastic piping systems and automotive applications. Further, the numerical models allow to investigate with higher accuracy and lower time different aspects such as manufacturing and non-linear effects. © Copyright 2018 ASME.},

abstract={In the last decades, the use of adhesives has rapidly increased in many industrial fields. Adhesive joints are often preferred to traditional fasteners due to the many advantages that they offer. For instance, adhesive joints show a better stress distribution compared to the traditional fasteners and high mechanical properties under different loading conditions. Furthermore, they are usually preferred for joining components made of different materials. A wide variety of adhesives is currently available: thermoset adhesives are generally employed for structural joints but recently there has been a significant increment in the use of thermoplastic adhesives, in particular of the hot-melt adhesives (HMAs). HMAs permit to bond a large number of materials, including metal and plastics (e.g., polypropylene, PP), which can be hardly bonded with traditional adhesives. Furthermore, HMAs are characterized by a short open time and, therefore, permit for a quick and easy assembly process since they can be easily spread on the adherend surfaces by means of a hot-melt gun and they offer the opportunity of an ease disassembling process for repair and recycle. For all these reasons, HMAs are employed in many industrial applications and are currently used also for bonding polypropylene and polyolefin piping systems. In the present paper, the dynamic response of single lap joints (SLJ) obtained by bonding together with a polyolefin HMA two polypropylene substrates was experimentally assessed. Quasi-static tests and dynamic tests were carried out to investigate the strain rate effect: dynamic tests were carried out with a modified instrumented impact pendulum. Relevant changes in the joint performance have been put in evidence. Failure modes were finally analysed and compared. A change in the failure mode is experimentally found: in quasi-static tests SLJ failed due to a cohesive failure of the adhesive, whereas in dynamic tests the SLJ failed due to an interfacial failure, with a low energy absorption. © Copyright 2018 ASME.},

abstract={Purpose: Detection and evaluation of damage due to impact or fatigue loading in components made by composite materials is one of the main concern for automotive engineers. We focus on damage due to impact loading on long fibre, plastic matrix composite, as they represent one of the most interesting development solution for automotive components toward lightweight structure that in turn means reduction of fuel consumption and of Green House Gas emissions. Design/methodology/approach: An innovative simplified methodology is proposed, based on the impact and repeated impact behaviour of composite material, for the evaluation of the induced damage and of material residual elastic properties. The investigated composite laminate is made of eight twill-wave carbon fabrics impregnated with epoxy resin. The methodology consists of two phases: at first the identification of the impact response. Composite plates have been impacted at different energy levels and residual elastic properties measured through standard tensile tests. The relationship between impact energy and residual elastic properties is obtained. Then the exploration impact load is identified, large enough to give a well-defined picture of the suffered damage but soft enough to do not induce further damage in the composite laminate. Findings: This exploration impact test and the Damage Index (DI) value, as interpretation key, leads to a prediction of the local residual elastic properties in the damaged area. The proposed methodology has been validated on plate specimens. A strict correlation is found between the predicted and the actual residual elastic properties of the damaged composite plate. Practical implications: Subsequently it has been applied to a composite beam, with a omega shape transverse section, that can be considered as a demonstrator for a typical beam used in the car body frame. Originality/value: A selection on the following alternatives will be possible: a – don’t care the damage is not affecting the structure performance; b – repair is needed but will be sufficient; c – substitute the damaged component as soon as possible. © International OCSCO World Press.

abstract={Experimental results have shown that high-strength steels can fail in the Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) regime with cracks originating from internal defects. Material cleanliness thus plays a major role in the VHCF response of high-strength steels and refinement processes (eg, electroslag remelting [ESR] and vacuum arc remelting) could significantly enhance their performance. The present paper aims at investigating the effect of the ESR process on the VHCF behavior of an AISI H13 steel by carrying out fully reversed ultrasonic tension-compression tests on hourglass specimens manufactured with and without the ESR process. Size effect is also taken into account in the paper: the effectiveness in the prediction of the VHCF response of specimens with large risk-volumes from experimental data on specimens with small risk-volumes is discussed and experimentally validated. © 2017 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The objective of this study is to evaluate the capability of the Impulse Excitation Technique (IET) in assessing the residual elastic properties of damaged composite laminates. To this aim, the Young's modulus in the longitudinal direction of undamaged and damaged thick laminates is evaluated both with the IET and with a tensile test, according to the ASTM standard. The differences between the reference ASTM values and the IET values are then interpreted through a simple mechanical model of the damaged laminate. Potentialities and weaknesses in the application of the IET for the assessment of the residual elastic properties are finally discussed and highlighted in the paper. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Mechanical properties of an epoxy based syntactic foams are discussed in this study. Basic syntactic foam, composed of 30% of hollow glass spheres by volume, was modified with a 1% volume fraction addition of graphene nano-platelets (GnP), treated GnPs and carbon black (CB). In treated GnPs the hollow glass spheres and the GnPs were treated with 1-Pyrenecarboxaldehyde in xylene. The flexural, tensile, compressive and Izod properties of the five different combinations of these syntactic foams, both reinforced and not reinforced, were measured and compared with the pristine epoxy. The tests show that the reinforced foams had a higher modulus in all cases. The maximum tensile load decreased with the addition of the GnPs, while it increased when CBs were used. Scanning electron micrographs were used to evaluate the dispersion of the filler in the epoxy matrix and the interaction between matrix and fillers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={It is well-known in the literature that the characteristic defect size of high-strength steels strongly influences their Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response. Currently, several refining processes permit to reduce the characteristic defect size and permit to remove large defects in high-strength steels, thus inducing a possible significant enhancement of the VHCF response. The present paper investigates the effects of a specific refinement process, the Electro-Slag Remelting (ESR), on the VHCF response of an AISI H13 steel. Ultrasonic VHCF tests are carried out on large Gaussian specimens made of unrefined and refined AISI H13 steels. Fracture surfaces are investigated to compare inclusion populations before and after the ESR process. Finally, the fatigue limit and the design S-N curves are statistically estimated to quantify the beneficial effects induced by the ESR process. © 2017 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Aim: To evaluate the ability of ProGlider instruments, PathFiles and K-files to maintain canal anatomy during glide path preparation using X-ray computed micro-tomography (micro-CT). Methodology: Forty-five extracted maxillary first permanent molars were selected. Mesio-buccal canals were randomly assigned (n = 15) to manual K-file, PathFile or ProGlider groups for glide path preparation. Irrigation was achieved with 5% NaOCl and 10% EDTA. After glide path preparation, each canal was shaped with ProTaper Next X1 and X2 to working length. Specimens were scanned (isotropic voxel size 9.1 μm) for matching volumes and surface areas and post-treatment analyses. Canal volume, surface area, centroid shift, canal geometry variation through ratio of diameter ratios and ratio of cross-sectional areas were assessed in the apical and coronal levels and at the point of maximum canal curvature. One-way factorial anovas were used to evaluate the significance of instrument in the various canal regions. Results: Post-glide path analysis revealed that instrument factor was significant at the apical level for both the ratio of diameter ratios and the ratio of cross-sectional areas (P < 0.001), with an improved maintenance of root canal geometry by ProGlider and PathFile. At the coronal level and point of maximum canal curvature, ProGlider demonstrated a tendency to pre-flare the root canal compared with K-file and PathFile. PathFile and ProGlider demonstrated a significantly lower centroid shift compared with K-file at the apical level (P = 0.023). Post-shaping analysis demonstrated a more centred preparation of ProGlider, compared with PathFile and K-files, with no significant differences for other parameters. Conclusions: Use of ProGlider instruments led to less canal transportation than PathFiles and K-files. © 2016 International Endodontic Journal. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={In the last decades, the use of composite materials for structural components is rapidly increasing. However, damage complexity still represents the main limitation in the further diffusion of structural composites. In this paper, an innovative non-destructive methodology for assessing the amount of damage in composite materials is proposed. The macro energetic variable Damage Index is exploited for the prediction of the local residual elastic properties in damaged composites for automotive applications. A strict correlation is found between the predicted and the actual residual elastic properties of the investigated plates. The methodology could thus represent an effective way for guiding the maintenance strategy in structural composite components subjected to damage during service. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={It is well-known that internal defects play a key role in the Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response of metallic materials. VHCF failures generally nucleate from internal defects, whose size strongly affects the material strength and life. Therefore, S-N curves in the VHCF regime are defect size dependent and the scatter of fatigue data is significantly influenced by the statistical distribution of the defect size within the material. The present paper proposes an innovative approach for the statistical modeling of Probabilistic-S-N (P-S-N) curves in the VHCF regime. The proposed model considers conditional P-S-N curves that depend on a specific value of the initial defect size. From the statistical distribution of the initial defect size, marginal P-S-N curves are estimated and the effect of the risk-volume on the VHCF response is also modeled. Finally, the paper reports a numerical example that quantitatively illustrates the concepts of conditional and marginal P-S-N curves and that shows the effect of the risk-volume on the VHCF response. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={It is well-known in the literature that fatigue cracks in VHCF originate from small internal defects. More than 95% of the total VHCF life is consumed in originating the so-called Fine Granular Area (FGA) around the small initial defect. Within the FGA, crack growth takes place even if the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is smaller than the threshold value for crack growth. Researchers proposed different explanations for this unexpected phenomenon but they unanimously accept that a weakening mechanism occurs around the initial defect, which permits crack growth below the SIF threshold. In the present paper, crack growth in the VHCF regime is innovatively modeled and a general expression for the fatigue limit is then obtained. The statistical distribution of the fatigue limit is also defined and a model for the fatigue limit as a function of the risk-volume is proposed. Finally, the proposed model is successfully applied to an experimental dataset. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Nowadays, selective laser melting (SLM) is considered as the most challenging technology for manufacturing complex components in different industrial fields, such as biomedical, aerospace and racing. It is well-known that SLM may yield to microstructures significantly different from those obtained by conventional casting, thus affecting the mechanical properties of the component. In the present paper, microstructural and mechanical tests were carried out on AlSi10Mg samples manufactured by SLM technique in the XY building configuration. Homogeneous composition and typical microstructures were achieved for all the investigated samples. The mechanical properties were assessed through a tensile test and through the Impulse Excitation Technique (IET). The feasibility of ultrasonic Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) tests with Gaussian specimens characterized by large loaded volumes (risk-volumes) was also experimentally verified in the paper. A Gaussian specimen was designed and manufactured. A preliminary ultrasonic test was then carried out on the manufactured specimen and the fracture surface was finally investigated.

abstract={It is well-known in the literature that internal defects play a major role in the Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response of metallic materials. Generally, VHCF failures nucleate from internal defects characterized by a limited size. Unexpectedly, it has been found that cracks can grow from the initial defect even if the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is quite below the characteristic threshold for crack growth. Even though researchers unanimously accept this singular experimental evidence, they still dispute about its physical justification. Different micromechanical explanations have been proposed in the literature: local grain refinement, carbide decohesion, matrix fragmentation, hydrogen embrittlement, numerous cyclic pressure and formation of persistent slip bands are the most famous proposals. Regardless of the specific micromechanical explanation, it is generally acknowledged that a weakening mechanism occurs around the initial defect, thus permitting crack growth below the SIF threshold. The present paper proposes an innovative approach for the quantitative modeling of the weakening process around the initial defect. The proposed model considers an additional SIF that reduces the SIF threshold of the material. Starting from a very general formulation for the additional SIF, possible scenarios for crack growth from the initial defect are also identified and described. It is theoretically demonstrated that, depending on the scenario, a VHCF limit may also be present and its final formulation recalls the well-known expression previously proposed by Murakami. © 2017 EW MATERIALS.

abstract={The correct computation of the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) in ultrasonic Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) loading conditions is a key issue when investigating the crack growth rate curve with pre-cracked specimens or when evaluating critical SIF values from fracture surfaces of failed specimens. Dynamic conditions related to the resonance of the vibrating specimen, contact nonlinearity between crack faces and stress singularity at the crack tip make the SIF computation difficult and cumbersome. Generally, numerical computation through Finite Element Models (FEMs) under non-linear dynamic conditions makes use of direct integration methods (implicit or explicit). However, in the high frequency regime of ultrasonic VHCF tests, the procedure may lead to an unacceptable computational time. In order to reduce the computational time, a hybrid procedure based on the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) and on the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) is originally presented and applied in this paper. The dynamic field parameters calculated with the HBM are used as input data for the computation of the SIF through the VCCT. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The continuous increment of durability and reliability requirements for many machinery components is significantly enhancing the research activity in the Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) characterization of metallic materials, in particular of high-strength steels for critical structural applications. According to the √area model, the VHCF strength of high-strength steels can be estimated from the projected area of the ‘Optically Dark Area’ (ODA), which plays a key role in the VHCF response of high-strength steels: more than 95% of the total VHCF life is consumed in the ODA formation, with crack growing even though the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is below the threshold for crack growth. Following the hydrogen embrittlement theory proposed by Murakami, hydrogen is supposed to assist crack growth within the ODA. The present paper proposes a general SIF formulation for the analytical model of the hydrogen assisted crack growth within the ODA. Starting from the general SIF formulation, a general expression for the material fatigue limit is obtained in the paper. The statistical method for the estimation of the parameters involved in the proposed model is finally illustrated in the paper and numerically applied to an experimental dataset. © 2016 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Experimental tests investigating Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) properties of materials are commonly performed with ultrasonic testing machines which allow for a significant reduction of testing time but induce a relevant temperature increment in specimens. In particular, due to the large volume of material (risk-volume) under test, Gaussian specimens, recently introduced for investigating size effects in VHCF, are extremely prone to heat dissipation and to the consequent temperature increment. They were originally designed by the Authors without considering the hysteretic damping and its effects on power dissipation: however, in order to evaluate the feasibility of ultrasonic fatigue tests with Gaussian specimens, hysteretic damping effects must be taken into account. The paper proposes an analytical model that permits to evaluate the effects of the hysteretic damping on the distribution of the power density and on the power dissipation in Gaussian specimens. The theoretical model is verified through Finite Element Models and experimentally validated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: To evaluate the influence of operator experience on adhesive technique and to assess the clinical performances of two different adhesive systems. Methods: 90 cervical lesions in 42 subjects, with a mean age of 52.4 years (range between 32-63) were selected. Lesions were divided into two groups according to operator experience (n= 42 restorations performed by a skilled operator, n= 48 restorations performed by five unexperienced operators) and further divided into two subgroups according to the adhesive system used: three-step etch-and-rinse (Optibond FL) or one step self-etch (G-Bond). Adhesives were applied according to manufacturers' instructions. Subjects underwent follow-up at 12, 24, and 36 months and restoration retention, enamel and dentin marginal integrity, marginal discoloration, caries occurrence, post-operative sensitivity, and preservation of tooth vitality were evaluated according to USPSH criteria. ANOVA test was performed to evaluate the influence of the adhesive system, the operator experience, and aging on restorations. Results: Operator experience (expert vs. inexperienced), aging time (12,24, or 36 months), and the adhesive system (self-etch vs. etch-and-rinse) all affected the results statistically, as did the interaction between the adhesive system and operator experience.},

abstract={Failures at very high number of cycles (Very-High-Cycle Fatigue, VHCF) generally originate from inclusions or defects present within the material. VHCF response of materials is therefore strongly affected by the defect population and, in particular, by the characteristic defect size, which statistically increases with the material volume. According to this well-known dependency, Size Effects were found to significantly affect the VHCF strength of high-strength steels. The paper aims at assessing the influence of Size Effects on the VHCF response of a high performance AISI H13 steel subjected to Electro Slag Remelting (ESR) refinement process. Ultrasonic VHCF tests were carried on specimens characterized by different loaded volumes (hourglass and Gaussian specimens). Experimental results showed that Size Effects strongly influences the VHCF response of the investigated high performance steel, even if it is characterized by a high degree of purity and by a population of inclusions with limited size.

abstract={Bonding is one of the key aspects of recent vehicle design, especially when multi-material structures are considered to contribute to the lightweight trend. Some innovative technologies, based on magneto sensitive nanoparticles dispersed in hot melt adhesive (HMA), have been already studied in order to reduce the cycle time of a vehicle and to allow for the recycling at the vehicle end of life. In this research activity, the effect of a 180 days normal ageing and three different accelerated ageing cycles (currently used by vehicle industries) of a thermoplastic adhesive with Iron (II,III) oxide nanoparticles embedded in the adhesive matrix have been studied. Performed Single Lap Joint (SLJ) tests prove the variations of the mechanical properties and adhesion strength during both the normal and accelerated ageings. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) have been used to reveal the different degradation levels among the various ageing cycles. Results have been conveniently compared and criticized in order to show the differences and the similarities between the normal ageing cycle and accelerated ones. © 2016, European Conference on Composite Materials, ECCM.

abstract={Experimental results have recently shown that failures at stress amplitude below the conventional fatigue limit and at Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) are possible. In case of high-strength steels, VHCF failures generally originate from defects/inclusions present within the material and, consequently, the defect population properties (size and quantity) significantly affect the VHCF response of high-strength steels. Different refinement processes are commonly adopted in order to improve steel cleanliness: among the other, the ElectroSlag Remelting (ESR) process allows to obtain very clean high-strength steels, thus possibly inducing a significant enhancement of the VHCF response. The present paper aims at investigating the actual effect of the ESR process on the VHCF behavior of an AISI H13 steel. Fully reversed ultrasonic tension-compression tests are carried out on hourglass specimens manufactured with and without the ESR process. The estimated P-S-N curves highlight the positive effects of the ESR process on the VHCF response of the investigated H13 steel. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={The continuous enhancement of reliability and durability requirements for many machinery components is significantly pushing the experimental research on the Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response of metallic materials. In order to significantly reduce testing time, ultrasonic testing machines are widely adopted when carrying out VHCF tests. Several fundamental material properties can be estimated from the fracture surfaces of specimens failed during ultrasonic VHCF tests. In the VHCF literature, the critical Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is generally estimated by applying analytical SIF formulations to the typical semi-circular surface crack geometry revealed by fracture surfaces at final failure. However, when subjected to ultrasonic VHCF tests, analytical SIF formulations valid for static loading conditions could eventually lead to significant estimation errors. The present paper aims at comparing the critical SIF at failure estimated from conventional analytical formulations, and from Finite Element Models (FEMs). The fracture surfaces of two specimens with different shapes (Hourglass and Gaussian) are taken into account for modeling crack geometry at final failure. Through an implicit solving procedure, the critical SIF in resonance condition at 20 kHz is computed from the 3D geometry of the cracked specimens and compared with the corresponding analytical prediction. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In recent years, experimental tests investigating properties of materials in gigacycle regime have suggested modifications to well-known statistical fatigue life models. Classical fatigue life models based on a single failure mode and on the presence of the fatigue limit, have been integrated by models that can take into account the occurrence of two failure modes (duplex S-N curve). Duplex S-N models involve a number of unknown parameters that must be statistically estimated from experimental data. The present paper proposes a simplified and automated procedure for statistical parameter estimation. Parameter estimation is carried out by applying the Maximum Likelihood Principle and by taking into account the possible presence of runout specimens with unequal number of cycles. The procedure is applied to experimental datasets taken from the literature. The application of the procedure permits to estimate different key material parameters (e.g., the characteristic parameters of transition stress and fatigue limit), as well as to statistically predict the failure mode of each tested specimen. © (2016) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In recent years, Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) behavior of metallic materials has become a major point of interest for researchers and industries. The needs of specific industrial fields (aerospace, mechanical and energy industry) for structural components with increasingly large fatigue lives, up to 1010 cycles (gigacycle fatigue), requested for a more detailed investigation on the experimental properties of materials in the VHCF regime. Gigacycle fatigue tests are commonly performed using resonance fatigue testing machines with a loading frequency of 20. kHz (ultrasonic tests). Experimental results showed that failure is due to cracks which nucleate at the specimen surface if the stress amplitude is above the conventional fatigue limit (surface nucleation) and that failure is generally due to cracks which nucleate from inclusions or internal defects (internal nucleation) when specimens are subjected to stress amplitudes below the conventional fatigue limit. Following the experimental evidence, the Authors recently proposed a new probabilistic model for the complete description of S-N curves both in the High-Cycle Fatigue (HCF) and in the VHCF fatigue regions (duplex S-N curves). The model differentiates between the two failure modes (surface and internal nucleation), according to the estimated distribution of the random transition stress (corresponding to the conventional fatigue limit). No assumption is made about the statistical distribution of the number of cycles at which the transition between surface and internal nucleation occurs (i.e., the Transition Fatigue Life TFL).In the present paper, the TFL distribution is obtained. The resulting distribution depends on the distance between the HCF and the VHCF regions and on the distribution of the random transition stress. It is also shown that the statistical distribution of the fatigue strength at the median TFL (i.e., the Transition Fatigue Strength TFS) has median which corresponds to the mean transition stress. Finally, a procedure for computing Likelihood Ratio Confidence Intervals (LRCIs) for both the median TFL and the median TFS is given in the paper. The estimated TFL and TFS distributions can be effectively used for properly choosing the duration of HCF tests in terms of number of cycles and the stress amplitude below which VHCF failures more probably occur. LRCIs for the median TFL and TFS can be usefully computed for assessing uncertainty in the estimation procedure when a limited number of experimental data is available.A numerical example based on an experimental dataset taken from the literature is provided. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction The finite element method (FEM) has been proposed as a method to analyze stress distribution in nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary instruments but has not been assessed as a method of predicting the number of cycles to failure (NCF). The objective of this study was to predict NCF and failure location of NiTi rotary instruments by FEM virtual simulation of an experimental nonstatic fatigue test. Methods ProTaper Next (PTN) X1, X2, and X3 files (Dentsply Maillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland) (n = 20 each) were tested to failure using a customized fatigue testing device. The device and file geometries were replicated with computer-aided design software. Computer-aided design geometries (geometric model) were imported and discretized (numeric model). The typical material model of an M-Wire alloy was applied. The numeric model of the device and file geometries were exported for finite element analysis (FEA). Multiaxial random fatigue methodology was used to analyze stress history and predict instrument life. Experimental data from PTN X2 and X3 were used for virtual model tuning through a reverse engineering approach to optimize material mechanical properties. Tuned material parameters were used to predict the average NCF and failure locations of PTN X1 by FEA; t tests were used to compare FEA and experimental findings (P <.05). Results Experimental NCF and failure locations did not differ from those predicted with FEA (P =.098). Conclusions File NCF and failure location may be predicted by FEA. Virtual design, testing, and analysis of file geometries could save considerable time and resources during instrument development. © 2015 American Association of Endodontists.},

abstract={Introduction The aim of this micro-computed tomography study was to describe the shaping properties of ProGlider/ProTaper Next (PG/PTN) and ScoutRace/BioRace (SR/BR) nickel-titanium rotary systems. Methods Thirty maxillary first permanent molars were selected. Mesiobuccal canals were randomly assigned (n = 15) to PG/PTN or SR/BR groups. Irrigation was performed with 5% NaOCl and 10% EDTA. Specimens were scanned (voxel size, 9.1 μm) for matching volumes and surface areas and post-treatment analyses. Root canal centering ability, canal geometry enlargement, and thickness of dentinal wall at inner curvature were assessed at apical level and point of maximum curvature. Results were analyzed with 4 one-way analyses of variance. Results Canal centering ability was superior in PG/PTN (P =.006 at apical level, P =.025 at point of maximum curvature). PG/PTN demonstrated a more conservative increase of canal areas (P =.027 at apical level, P =.038 at point of maximum curvature). Centrifugal increase in canal diameters did not significantly differ between groups (P =.65 at apical level, P =.61 at point of maximum curvature). Inner dentinal wall thickness was less reduced with PG/PTN compared with SR/BR, with no statistical differences (P =.23 at point of maximum curvature, P =.89 at apical level). PG/PTN shaping taper ranged between 6% and 7%. Conclusions Neither system produced significant shaping errors in curved canals. PG/PTN system showed better preservation of canal anatomy. PTN offset section did not influence final preparation taper. © 2015 American Association of Endodontists.},

abstract={Objectives To evaluate retrospectively the longevity of endodontically treated teeth restored with direct resin composite without cusp coverage, with or without the insertion of fibre posts. The null hypothesis was that direct restorations with fibre posts perform better than those without fibre posts. Methods Patients recruited for this study were treated in the Department of Cariology and Operative Dentistry, University of Turin, between 2008 and 2011. In total, 247 patients with 376 root treated posterior teeth, restored with direct resin composite, were recalled for a control visit. Only second-class cavities were considered. Two groups were defined based on the absence (Group A) or presence (Group B) of fibre post. Failures and complications, such as periodontal failure, endodontic failure, tooth extraction, root fracture, post fracture, post debonding, replacement of restoration, crown displacement, and coronal-tooth fracture, were noted. Functional restoration quality was evaluated following the modified USPHS criteria. Data were evaluated statistically with ANOVA. Results Group A consisted of 128 patients with 178 restorations (88 premolars, 90 molars) with a median follow-up of 34.44 months. Group B consisted of 119 patients with 198 teeth (92 premolars, 106 molars) with a median follow-up of 35.37 months. Direct restorations with fibre posts were statistically significantly more functional (95.12% success) than those without fibre posts (80% success) because of less marginal discolouration, better marginal integrity, and higher restoration integrity. Conclusions The null hypothesis was accepted because direct post-endodontic restorations with fibre posts performed better than restorations without posts after 3 years of masticatory function. Clinical significance An evaluation of the longevity of post endodontic direct restoration would seem to enhance the fiber post insertion within a composite restoration to reduce clinical failures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The present initiative provides a summary overview on Graphene Related materials (GRM) for automotive applications and investigates efficient ways to integrate Graphene as polymer reinforcements within composite materials for energy-efficient and safe vehicles (EESVs). An approach that starts from the nano-scale through the Graphene elaboration by experiments to meso/macro-scale by continuum mechanics modelling is discussed with respect to some limiting factors in terms of the large scale production, the interfacial behaviour, the amount of wrinkling and network structure. Finally, a strategy for modelling such a composite is elaborated in the framework of the Graphene Flagship to well understand such limitations for a full applicability of Graphene. It is anticipated that this initiative will advance innovative lightweight graphene composites and their related modelling, designing, manufacturing, and joining capabilities suitable for automotive industry which requires unique levels of affordability, mechanical performance, green environmental impact and energy efficiency. This leads to complete understanding of the new graphene composites and their applicability in high-volume production scenarios. © 2015 International Committee on Composite Materials.

abstract={Experimental tests investigating very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) properties of materials are commonly performed with ultrasonic testing machines, which allow for a significant reduction of testing time. In order to evaluate the effect of tested material volume (size-effect) on VHCF properties, the Authors recently proposed to adopt Gaussian specimens for VHCF tests. Investigation of size-effect with Gaussian specimen induces large mechanical power dissipation and temperature increment that must be taken into account. The present paper proposes an analytical model, which allows to approximately predict the dissipated mechanical power and the temperature increment in Gaussian specimens. The analytical model is also numerically verified through a Finite Element Analysis.},

abstract={In recent years, very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) behavior of metallic materials has become a major point of interest for researchers and industries. The needs of specific industrial fields (aerospace, mechanical and energy industry) for structural components with increasingly large fatigue lives, up to 1010 cycles (gigacycle fatigue), requested for a more detailed investigation on the experimental properties of materials in the VHCF regime. Gigacycle fatigue tests are commonly performed using resonance fatigue testing machines with a loading frequency of 20 kHz (ultrasonic tests). Experimental results showed that failure is due to cracks which nucleate at the specimen surface if the stress amplitude is above the conventional fatigue limit (surface nucleation) and that failure is generally due to cracks which nucleate from inclusions or internal defects (internal nucleation) when specimens are subjected to stress amplitudes below the conventional fatigue limit. Following the experimental evidence, the Authors recently proposed a new statistical model for the complete description of SN curves both in the high-cycle-fatigue (HCF) and in the VHCF fatigue regions (Duplex S-N curves). The model differentiates between the two failure modes (surface and internal nucleation), according to the estimated distribution of the random transition stress (corresponding to the conventional fatigue limit). No assumption is made about the statistical distribution of the number of cycles at which the transition between surface and internal nucleation occurs (i.e., the transition fatigue life). In the present paper, the statistical distribution of the transition fatigue life is obtained, according to the statistical model proposed. The resulting distribution depends on the distance between the HCF and the VHCF regions and on the distribution of the random transition stress. The estimated distribution can be effectively used to predict, with a specified confidence level, the number of cycles for which an internal nucleation may probabilistically occur in a VHCF test and it is also informative for properly choosing the end of HCF tests in terms of number of cycles. A numerical example, based on experimental datasets taken from the literature, is provided. © 2014, Gruppo Italiano Frattura. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Aim: To evaluate ex vivo the bond strength and adaptation of fibre posts with oval and circular cross sections luted in oval canals with post spaces prepared using dedicated drills or ultrasonic tips. Methodology: Forty extracted premolars with oval canals were root filled, then randomly divided into four groups according to the post space preparation device and the shape of the luted fibre post: dedicated drill + round post, dedicated drill + oval post, ultrasonic tip + round post and ultrasonic tip + oval post. Posts were cemented with a self-adhesive cement (RelyX Unicem 2; 3M ESPE). Samples were sectioned in 1-mm-thick slices and observed under a microscope, and the area occupied by the post within the post space area was calculated. Bond strength was then measured using a push-out test, and the failure modes were evaluated with a stereomicroscope at 40× magnification. Fibre post adaptation and push-out test results were evaluated by analysis of variance (P < 0.05). Results: Fibre posts, both round and oval, were better adapted to the apical region of the post space (P = 0.001). In oval canals, the bond strength was significantly higher in coronal regions, when the post space was prepared with a dedicated drill and an oval post was luted (P < 0.0001). Adhesive failures between cement and post were the most frequent type of failure in all groups. Conclusions: Circular and oval posts achieved similar adaptation to oval canals, but the use of ultrasonic tips and round posts resulted in reduced bond strength values. © 2013 International Endodontic Journal.},

abstract={Experimental tests investigating the gigacycle fatigue properties of materials are commonly performed with ultrasonic testing procedures, which allow for a significant reduction of testing time but induce a significant temperature increment in specimens. In order to evaluate the significance of size effects on the fatigue strength of materials, the Authors recently proposed to adopt Gaussian specimens for gigacycle tests. Fatigue specimens were designed without taking into account the hysteretic damping and its effects both on the stress distribution and on the heat power dissipation. However, in order to evaluate the temperature increment and the feasibility of ultrasonic fatigue tests with Gaussian specimens, the total dissipated heat power as well as the distribution of the dissipated heat power density along the specimen must be taken into account. The present paper proposes an analytical model validated through a finite element analysis, which permits to evaluate the effects of the hysteretic damping on the stress distribution, on the dissipated heat power density distribution and on the total dissipated heat power in Gaussian specimens. © 2014 The Authors.

abstract={Literature datasets showed that gigacycle fatigue properties of materials may be affected by the specimen risk-volume, i.e., the part of the specimen subjected to applied stress amplitudes above a prescribed percentage of the maximum applied stress amplitude. The paper proposes a Gaussian specimen shape able to attain large risk-volumes for gigacycle fatigue tests, together with a general procedure for its design: wave propagation equations are analytically solved in order to obtain a specimen shape characterised by a uniform stress distribution on an extended length and, as a consequence, by a larger risk-volume. The uniformity of the stress distribution in the Gaussian specimen is numerically verified through a finite element analysis and experimentally validated by means of strain gauge measurements. © 2014 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the marginal sealing ability of a bulk fill flowable resin composite on both enamel and dentin substrates. Materials and Methods: 48 non-carious molars were selected and four Class-V cavities were prepared at the CEJ of each sample. Cavities were filled with Venus Diamond (Heraeus Kulzer); Venus Diamond Flow (Heraeus Kulzer) and Surefil SDR (Dentsply). Samples were divided into two groups: First group samples were immersed in a methylene blue solution for 30 min at 25°C. Second group samples were artificially aged and then treated with methylene blue. Samples were sectioned in the center of the restoration and observed with a 40x stereomicroscope, and the percentage of cavity infiltration was calculated. Results: Results were analyzed statistically by ANOVA (P < 0.05). The amount of infiltration was significantly lower for the enamel substrate compared with dentin (P = 0.0001) and in samples immediately immersed in methylene blue compared with those that were artificially aged (P = 0.011). The interaction between the composite material and the marginal substrate significantly affected dye penetration (P = 0.006). Conclusions: Bulk fill flowable resins provided significantly better marginal seal in dentin, both before and after artificial ageing. Nanohybrid resin composites and bulk fill flowable resins showed similar microleakage values at enamel margins. Bulk fills flowable resins provided significantly better marginal seal in dentin, both before and after artificial ageing. Nanohybrid resin composites and bulk fill flowable resins showed similar microleakage values at enamel margins. © 2014 Dental Investigations Society.},

abstract={The present paper investigates the application of the stochastic approach when the commonly adopted Miner's linear damage rule is implemented, both in its traditional and modified forms to include the presence of a random stress threshold (random fatigue limit), below which the rate of damage accumulation is reduced. Main steps are provided to obtain the simulated distribution of the accumulated damage under variable amplitude loading. When the stochastic approach is applied in the presence of a random fatigue limit, an additional correlation structure, which takes into account the fatigue limit value, must be introduced in the analysis. If the number of cycles to failure under constant amplitude loading is Weibull (Log-Normal) distributed, then the corresponding accumulated damage is Fréchet (Log-Normal) distributed. The effects of the correlation structure on reliability prediction under variable amplitude loading are also investigated. To this aim, several experimental datasets are taken from the literature, covering various metallic materials and variable amplitude block sequences. The results show that the choice of the damage accumulation model is a key factor to value the improvement in the accuracy of reliability predictions introduced by the stochastic approach. Comparison of the predicted number of cycles to failure with experimental data shows that larger errors are non-conservative, regardless of the adopted correlation structure. When the analysis is limited to reliability levels above 80%, for these large non-conservative errors, it is the quantile approach to be closer to actual experimental data, thus limiting the overestimation of component's life. For the experimental datasets considered in the paper, adoption of a stochastic approach would improve the accuracy of Miner's predictions in 10% of cases. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

In order to increase the volume of material subjected to the maximum stress (risk volume) a new specimen shape with a Gaussian profile is proposed. An approximation of the Gaussian profile with an arc of circle is presented in the paper, in order to simplify the Gaussian specimen manufacturing process.

abstract={The literature presents several analytical models and solutions for single- and double-lap bonded joints, whilst the joint between circular tubes is less common. For this geometry the pioneering model is that of Lubkin and Reissner, Transactions of The ASME 78 (1956) 1213-1221, in which the tubes are treated as cylindrical thin shells subjected to membrane and bending loading, whilst the adhesive transmits shear and peel stresses which are a function of the axial coordinate only. Such assumptions are consistent with those usually adopted for the flat joints. A former investigation has shown that the L-R model agrees with FE results for many geometries and gives far better results than other models appeared later in the literature. The aim of the present work is to obtain and present an explicit closed-form solution, not reported by Lubkin and Reissner, which is achieved by solving the governing equations by means of the Laplace transform. The correctness of the findings, assessed by the comparison with the tabular results of Lubkin and Reissner, and the features of this solution are commented. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Statement of problem The choice of restorative method is commonly based on the cavity configuration and the residual number of cavity walls. However, the residual wall thickness could be a valuable clinical parameter in the choice of restoration for endodontically treated teeth. Purpose The fracture resistance of endodontically treated premolars was compared with different wall thicknesses restored with direct composite resin with and without cuspal coverage and with and without fiber post insertion. Material and methods This study included 104 intact human maxillary premolars extracted for periodontal or orthodontic reasons. Standardized mesio-occluso-distal cavities were prepared with different palatal wall thicknesses (1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm) and a buccal wall thickness of 2 mm. Teeth were restored with or without a fiber post and with or without cuspal coverage. Specimens were subjected to thermocycling (3000 cycles, 5 to 55 C) and embedded in polymerized acrylic resin. Teeth were submitted to cyclic fatigue followed by a static fatigue test with a universal testing machine; a compressive force was applied 30 degrees to the long axis of the teeth until fracture. The results were statistically analyzed by 3-way ANOVA (α=.05). Results Residual wall thickness (P=.004), the type of adhesive restoration (P<.001), and fiber post insertion (P<.001) significantly influenced the fracture resistance of endodontically treated premolars. Conclusions In specimens with a cavity wall thickness >2 mm, direct intracuspal composite resin restorations supported by a fiber post achieved comparable fracture resistance. With a residual wall thickness <2 mm, only cuspal coverage with or without a fiber post provided satisfactory fracture resistance.},

abstract={The present paper proposes a statistical model for describing sigmoidal crack growth rate curves. Major novelties are: a) exploitation of the maximum likelihood principle for obtaining material estimates by pooling together experimental data belonging to the different crack propagation regions; b) a general formulation which allows to adopt different sigmoidal models and any kind of statistical distribution for the model variables; c) fatigue life predictions through numerical integration of analytical functions with no need of Monte Carlo simulations. Experimental data taken from NASGRO database are used to check the validity of the statistical model in estimating material parameters included in the crack growth NASGRO algorithm. Illustrative plots of number of cycles to failure and crack length after a given number of cycles are presented, showing good agreement between the proposed statistical model and NASGRO results. © 2012 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A design-by-reliability approach is ever more required and accurate design inputs are needed to meet reliability targets while reducing costs. Different models have been proposed in the literature to describe fatigue life variation with respect to the applied stress by assuming the applied stress as a deterministic independent variable and the fatigue life as a dependent random variable. In the paper also the applied stress is considered as a random variable with its own uncertainty and the procedure to evaluate the error on the estimation of parameters usually adopted in service reliability assessment of structural components is shown. Exact equations are proposed for some special cases and an illustrative example showing the reliability errors originated by applying the ASTM recommendations is given. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, experimental tests exploring the gigacycle fatigue properties of materials suggest the introduction of modifications in well-known statistical fatigue life models. Usual fatigue life models, characterized by a single failure mechanism and by the presence of the fatigue limit, have been integrated by models that can take into account the occurrence of two failure mechanisms and do not consider the presence of the fatigue limit. The general case, in which more than two failure mechanisms coexist with the fatigue limit, has not been proposed yet. The paper presents a unified statistical model which can take into account any number of failure mechanisms and the possible presence of the fatigue limit. The case of S-N curves with different fatigue life distributions coexisting for the entire stress range covered by fatigue tests is also considered. The adaptability of the statistical model to the S-N curves proposed in the open literature is demonstrated by qualitative numerical examples. © 2012 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Gigacycle fatigue properties of materials are strongly affected by the specimen risk volume (volume of material subjected to a stress amplitude larger than the 90% of the maximum stress). Gigacycle fatigue tests, performed with ultrasonic fatigue testing machines, are commonly carried out by using hourglass shaped specimens with a small risk volume. The adoption of traditional dog-bone specimens allows for increasing the risk volume, even if the increment is quite limited. In order to obtain larger risk volumes, a new specimen shape is proposed (Gaussian specimen). The dog-bone and the Gaussian specimens are compared through Finite Element Analyses and the numerical results are validated experimentally by means of strain gages measurements. The range of applicability of the two different specimens in terms of available risk volume and stress concentration effects due to the cross section variation is determined.},

abstract={Objective: This study evaluated the variation of conversion degree (DC) in the 12 hours following initial photoactivation of a low-shrinkage composite resin (Venus Diamond). Material and Methods: The conversion degree was monitored for 12 hours using Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) F-TIR Spectroscopy. The composite was placed in 1 or 2 mm rings and cured for 10 or 20 seconds with a LED lamp. ATR spectra were acquired from the bottom surface of each sample immediately after the initial photoactivation (P=0), 30 minutes (P=0.5) and 12 hours after photoactivation (P=12) in order to obtain the DC progression during the post-curing period. Interactions between thickness (T), irradiation time (I) and post-curing (P) on the DC were calculated through ANOVA testing. Results: All the first order interactions were statistically significant, with the exception of the T-P interaction. Furthermore, the shift from P=0 to P=0.5 had a statistically higher influence than the shift from P=0.5 to P=12. The post-curing period played a fundamental role in reaching higher DC values with the low-shrinkage composite resin tested in this study. Moreover, both the irradiation time and the composite thickness strongly influenced the DC. Conclusions: Increased irradiation time may be useful in obtaining a high conversion degree (DC) with a low-shrinkage nano-hybrid composite resin, particularly with 2 mm composite layers.},

abstract={Introduction: This study compared the canal curvature and axis modification after instrumentation with WaveOne Primary reciprocating files (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) and nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary ProTaper (Dentsply Maillefer). Methods: Thirty ISO 15, 0.02 taper, Endo Training Blocks (Dentsply Maillefer) were used. In all specimens, the glide path was achieved with PathFile 1, 2, and 3 (Dentsply Maillefer) at the working length (WL). Specimens were then assigned to 1 of 2 groups for shaping: specimens in group 1 were shaped with ProTaper S1-S2-F1-F2 at the WL and specimens in group 2 were shaped with WaveOne Primary reciprocating files at the WL. Pre- and postinstrumentation digital images were superimposed and processed with Matlab r2010b (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA) software to analyze the curvature-radius ratio (CRr) and the relative axis error (rAe), representing canal curvature modification. Data were analyzed with one-way balanced analyses of variance at 2 levels (P &lt;.05). Results: The instrument factor was extremely significant for both the CRr parameter (F1 = 9.59, P =.004) and the rAe parameter (F1 = 13.55, P =.001). Conclusions: Canal modifications are reduced when the new WaveOne NiTi single-file system is used. © 2012 American Association of Endodontists.},

abstract={Introduction: X-ray computed micro-tomography scanning allows high-resolution 3-dimensional imaging of small objects. In this study, micro-CT scanning was used to compare the ability of manual and mechanical glide path to maintain the original root canal anatomy. Methods: Eight extracted upper first permanent molars were scanned at the TOMOLAB station at ELETTRA Synchrotron Light Laboratory in Trieste, Italy, with a microfocus cone-beam geometry system. A total of 2,400 projections on 360° have been acquired at 100 kV and 80 μA, with a focal spot size of 8 μm. Buccal root canals of each specimen (n = 16) were randomly assigned to PathFile (P) or stainless-steel K-file (K) to perform glide path at the full working length. Specimens were then microscanned at the apical level (A) and at the point of the maximum curvature level (C) for post-treatment analyses. Curvatures of root canals were classified as moderate (≤35°) or severe (≥40°). The ratio of diameter ratios (RDRs) and the ratio of cross-sectional areas (RAs) were assessed. For each level of analysis (A and C), 2 balanced 2-way factorial analyses of variance (P <.05) were performed to evaluate the significance of the instrument factor and of canal curvature factor as well as the interactions of the factors both with RDRs and RAs. Results: Specimens in the K group had a mean curvature of 35.4°± 11.5°; those in the P group had a curvature of 38°± 9.9°. The instrument factor (P and K) was extremely significant (P <.001) for both the RDR and RA parameters, regardless of the point of analysis. Conclusions: Micro-CT scanning confirmed that NiTi rotary PathFile instruments preserve the original canal anatomy and cause less canal aberrations.

abstract={The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the surface roughness of enamel margins resulting by the use of rotating, sonic and ultrasonic devices for cavity margins finishing. Forty-eight anterior intact teeth were selected for this study. Each item was sectioned 1 mm below the CEJ, perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth, with the carborundum separating disk mounted on the high-speed handpiece. With the same bur the crown was separated into two parts along the midline vertically. At the end 96 "half-crowns" were obtained. The samples were divided into 6 groups of 8 samples each, according to enamel margin's finishing technique (A and B: diamond ultrasonic tip; C: multisteel ultrasonic tip; D: fine diamond rotating bur; E: ultra-fine diamond rotating bur; F: sonicflex prep). The surface roughness evaluation of the enamel of each sample has been carried out by using a profilometer. The statistical analysis was performed with a balanced hierarchical ANOVA. The results of this in vitro study showed that the enamel roughness obtained with sonic and ultrasonic devices was significantly higher than roughness obtained with rotating burs. Within the sonic and ultrasonic tips, the multisteel ones gave better results, that were comparable to diamond sonic device.},

abstract={Introduction: This study evaluated the influence of glide path on canal curvature and axis modification after instrumentation with WaveOne Primary reciprocating files. Methods: Thirty ISO 15, 0.02 taper Endo Training Blocks were used. In group 1, glide path was created with PathFile 1, 2, and 3 at working length, whereas in group 2, glide path was not performed. In both groups, canals were shaped with WaveOne Primary reciprocating files at working length. Preinstrumentation and postinstrumentation digital images were superimposed and processed with Matlab r2010b software to analyze the curvature radius ratio (CRr) and the relative axis error (rAe), representing canal curvature modification. Data were analyzed with 1-way balanced analyses of variance at 2 levels (P <.05). Results: Glide path was found to be extremely significant for both CRr parameter (F = 9.59; df = 1; P =.004) and rAe parameter (F = 13.55; df = 1; P =.001). Conclusions: Canal modifications seem to be significantly reduced when previous glide path is performed by using the new WaveOne nickel-titanium single-file system.

abstract={Introduction: This study evaluated the working length (WL) modification after instrumentation with WaveOne Primary (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) reciprocating files and the incidence of overinstrumentation in relation to the initial WL. Methods: Thirty-two root canals of permanent teeth were used. The angles of curvature of the canals were calculated on digital radiographs. The initial WL with K-files was transferred to the matched WaveOne Primary reciprocating files. After glide paths were established with PathFile (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), canals were shaped with WaveOne Primary referring to the initial WL. The difference between the postinstrumentation canal length and the initial canal length was analyzed by using a fiberoptic inspection microscope. Data were analyzed with a balanced 2-way factorial analysis of variance (P &lt;.05). Results: Referring to the initial WL, 24 of 32 WaveOne Primary files projected beyond the experimental apical foramen (minimum-maximum, 0.14-0.76 mm). A significant decrease in the canal length after instrumentation (95% confidence interval ranging from -0.34 mm to -0.26 mm) was detected. The canal curvature significantly influenced the WL variation (F 1 = 30.65, P &lt;.001). The interaction between the initial canal length and the canal curvature was statistically significant (F 2 = 4.38, P =.014). Conclusions: Checking the WL before preparation of the apical third of the root canal is recommended when using the new WaveOne NiTi single-file system. © 2011 American Association of Endodontists.},

abstract={Mechanical response of E-glass/epoxy fiber reinforced composite was investigated in tensile loading. Different types of tabs were considered in order to evaluate their effects on the tensile strength of material. Specifically, two types of molded tabs and five types of bonded tabs were considered in the study. The influence of different amount of gripping pressures on failure mode and on tensile strength of specimens was also considered in the analysis. The experimental results showed that the tabs configuration affected the tensile strength of the specimens. Starting from the experimental results, an appropriate testing methodology is proposed for E-glass/epoxy fiber reinforced composite specimens in order to reduce problems that may arise during the test and to optimize procedures for preparation of specimens. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Fernandez (2007) first obtained some of the results proposed in this article, but, differently from what are proposed here, and developed his theory starting from a generalized pivot. An illustrative example shows that, with the expressions proposed in this article, it is also possible to overcome some shortcomings raising from the formulas by Fernandez (2007). Finally, a new expression for the moments of the pivot is obtained. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In the paper, data of repeated impact tests performed on seven laminates of different lay-up and thickness are used to illustrate how the damage index (DI), a damage variable recently introduced by the authors to monitor the range of the penetration process in thick laminates, can be applied in case of repeated impact tests to get information on the rate of initial steady damage accumulation as well as on the onset of severe damage modes. Curves of the rate of growth of the DI in the steady phase (ΔDI/ΔN) vs. the normalised impact energy (ratio of the impact energy Ei and the laminate penetration threshold Pn) show no significant damage accumulation besides initial specimen indentation for impact energies below 0.2Pn. For intermediate levels of impact energy, repeated impact tests are characterised by an initial region of steady damage accumulation followed by an abrupt change in the rate of damage growth a few impacts before laminate perforation. For higher impact energies (Ei/Pn &gt; 0.4-0.45), no phase of steady damage accumulation is present, suggesting that severe damage mechanisms take place from the very first impacts. Values of the DI at the end of the steady phase (DIunsteady) are shown to be rather peculiar to each laminate regardless of the impact energy used in the tests and therefore may be used to get a first indication of the laminate performance to repeated impacts. The extent of the steady phase may also be used to compute the total energy absorbed by the laminate in the steady damage accumulation phase (EaTOT_steady). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A damage variable (damage degree DD) representing the ratio between the absorbed energy and the impact energy was introduced in 1998 by Belingardi and Vadori to assess damage accumulation caused by low velocity impacts. More recently, repeated impact tests carried out on thick laminates pointed out the significance and extent of the penetration process in thick laminates, which the DD is unable to monitor as, by definition, it reaches the value of one at penetration to remain unchanged over the entire penetration process. In the present paper, a new damage variable (damage index DI) is proposed to overcome shortcomings of the DD with respect to thick laminates. By introducing the displacement of the impactor into the definition of the DI, the depth of the penetration process is taken into account. Normalization by the displacement of the quasi-static perforation test allows for a non-dimensional damage variable which is shown to reach the value of one at perforation. Validity of the approach is proven against impact data obtained for different fibre-matrix architectures and laminate thickness. Results show that the DI can effectively differentiate between penetration and perforation thresholds, increasing monotonically within the range of the penetration process. In particular, the DI is shown to increase linearly with the impact energy up to penetration and to rise quite abruptly within the range of the penetration process. Results for repeated impact tests prove that at first the DI increases quite linearly impact after impact, owing to a steady accumulation of damage. A few impacts before penetration a sudden rise in the DI value points out a change in the rate of damage accumulation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Vacuum infusion (VI) is being considered as a viable alternative to more traditional hand lay-up (HL). Main reason in favor of the more costly technique is the cleaner and friendlier work environment. Moreover, VI potentially offers another important benefit over HL in that prepreg levels of resin may be achieved, resulting in stronger and lighter laminates. The present paper compares the two manufacturing techniques on the basis of the response to repeated impact loading. The laminate is a thick non-symmetric glass-fiber-reinforced plastics intended for nautical application. Four impact velocities (1.5, 2.2, 3.1 and 3.8 m/s) were considered, and a minimum of four specimens for any given velocity were subjected to 40 repeated impacts or up to perforation. The impact response was evaluated in terms of damage progression by visual observation of the impacted specimens, evolution of the peak force and of the bending stiffness with the number of impacts and by calculating the Damage Index (DI), a damage variable recently proposed by the authors to monitor the penetration process in thick laminates. Results point out that for impact velocities for which no perforation occurs within test duration, the experimental data essentially overlap. On the contrary, for perforation tests, HL specimens survived more impacts before perforating absorbing more total energy than VI specimens. Plots of the DI variable against the number of impacts were observed to exhibit an initial linear portion, owing to a stable process of damage accumulation within the laminate, and to undergo an unstable growth a few impacts before perforation. When comparing the VI and HL specimens it was observed that, given an impact energy, the level of damage at first impact as well as the rate of stable damage accumulation is alike for the two sets of specimens. On the contrary, it is the number of impacts of the stable damage accumulation region which is lower for VI specimens. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A new method, theoretically justified, is proposed to overcome difficulties in analysing reliability data coming from Type I censored samples. The article shows that, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, it is possible to obtain quasi-exact likelihood estimator properties and conservative confidence intervals for log-location-scale distributions. In the case of the exponential distribution, comparisons with the exact estimator properties show that the Monte Carlo approach allows to calculate the properties with very good accuracy. Finally, for the exponential distribution it is demonstrated that, if the number of failures can only be different from zero, confidence intervals based on the asymptotic properties of the likelihood estimators may give statistically meaningless results in the case of small sample size (3-10) and low probability of failure (.05-.20).},

abstract={The paper describes the FE modelling and experimental validation of a composite bolted joint loaded in bending and torsion. The selected material is a hybrid glass-carbon non-woven fabric in epoxy matrix; the manufacturing technology is hand lay-up with vacuum bagging. Following a material characterization run on standard specimens, six joints were subjected to monotonic or cyclic loading, followed by monotonic loading until failure. Results show that components exhibit lower reduction in stiffness and strength due to cycling compared to standard specimens. Also, the ratio between the maximum load for which no stiffness or strength degradation was observed in 106 cycles and the static ultimate load were higher for components than for specimens. The modelling activity focuses on the simulation of the monotonic test. Numerical results show a good correlation with experiments in terms of material stiffness in the linear range and in predicting the regions of failure as highly stressed areas. However, being the analysis linear, a quantitative correlation between calculated stresses and ply strength properties was only found for the first ply failure. © 2006.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to investigate the response to repeated impacts of a non-symmetric glass fibre reinforced laminate. The laminate is intended for a nautical application and the manufacturing technique is vacuum infusion. In a first part of the work, four impact velocities (1.566 m/s, 2.215 m/s, 3.132 m/s and 3.836 m/s) were considered, and a minimum of four specimens for any given velocity were subjected to forty repeated impacts or up to perforation. The impact response was evaluated in terms of damage progression by visual observation of the impacted specimens, evolution of the peak force and of the bending stiffness with the number of impacts and by calculating the damage degree (ratio between the absorbed energy and the impact energy). In a second part of the work, additional single impact tests were performed at 4.429 m/s and 6.264 m/s to investigate the laminate strain-rate sensitivity. Repeated impact tests pointed out that the delamination area grows very rapidly in the first few impacts to then level off, following closely the behaviour of the bending stiffness against the number of impacts. The value of the peak force increases in the first few impacts due to compaction and strain-hardening of the resin with a related decrease of the damage degree. Comparison between quasi-static penetration tests and impact tests demonstrates a strain-rate dependency of the laminate bending stiffness and first damage load. The values of R2 show a good fitness of a linear function on the experimental data.},

abstract={Vacuum infusion is now being considered as a viable alternative to more traditional hand lay-up. Main reason in favor of the more costly technique is the cleaner and friendlier work environment. However, vacuum infusion potentially offers another important benefit over hand lay-up in that prepreg levels of resin may be achieved, resulting in stronger and lighter laminates. The present paper compares the two manufacturing techniques on the basis of the response to repeated impact loading. The laminate is a non-symmetric glass fiber reinforced plastics intended for nautical application. Four impact velocities (1.5 m/s, 2.2 m/s, 3.1 m/s and 3.8 m/s) were considered, and a minimum of four specimens for any given velocity were subjected to forty repeated impacts or up to perforation. The impact response was evaluated in terms of damage progression by visual observation of the impacted specimens, evolution of the peak force and of the bending stiffness with the number of impacts and by calculating the damage degree (ratio between the absorbed energy and the impact energy). Results point out that for impact velocities for which no perforation occurs within test duration, the experimental data of the two series essentially overlap. On the contrary, for perforation tests, the number of impacts to perforation is smaller for vacuum infusion specimens. Copyright © 2006 by ASME.},
